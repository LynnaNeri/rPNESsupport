He told me it is prescribed to much older patients like in their 70‚Äôs, etc. It really was the best for my anxiety, sleep and seizures. It is unfortunate that it‚Äôs a considered a problem long term. \n\nAs a side note, I took 1 mg at night.

It‚Äôs definitely something to discuss with your doctor to make sure you‚Äôre making an educated decision about how long you use clonazepam. Keeping an eye on how often you use it is a good idea as well because it can be habit forming. I was on benzos for about 10 years & didn‚Äôt have issues but was very vigilant about not over using.

h5yn6ak,oofzkm,"Yeah, I get that.  I started having PNES events in June 2015.  Mine don‚Äôt resemble any kind of epileptic seizure at all.  For me, it‚Äôs like the hippocampi stop working, so I can‚Äôt form any memories.  Everyone tells me that I‚Äôm still ‚Äúme‚Äù when this is going on, but that I‚Äôm very confused.  I can still do anything I already know how to do, though I may not know why I‚Äôm doing it.  From my perspective, I suddenly cease to exist till the event is over.  Then it takes several minutes to completely recover my memory.\n\nThe first time, my hubby thought I was having a stroke, so he rushed me to the the ER.   I recovered while there, and all tests were normal.  They diagnosed Temporary Global Amnesia.  When it happened again, a neurologist (who had the bedside manner of a prickly pear cactus) declared it was temporal lobe epilepsy, in spite of all tests being negative, and my symptoms not fitting that at all.  After getting increasing doses of Keppra for six months, the frequency and duration of my events also increased.  \n\nFinally, I went to an epileptologist.  She is my hero!  She saw that it wasn‚Äôt epilepsy; it was PNES, and I was weened off the Keppra.  I was sent for a sleep study and am now treated for multiple sleep disorders.  PNES got a little better.  A history of abuse/PTSD is a major cause, and I was finally diagnosed with Complex PTSD, and eventually I started EMDR in 2019, finishing April 2021.  It‚Äôs been a damn long haul, but worth it.  I know I will probably always have PNES, but it is better now, as is my whole life in general.

h60cks7,oofzkm,"I started to have seizures at age 43, (in 2009) and am still officially dx with partial complex epilepsy. My seizures stop when I take anti-convulsants (I am currently on Depakote).

THAT EEG was abnormal.\n\nI have read ALL about PNES and the only thing that I fit is my LONG history of trauma and disassociation. My seizures last under a minute and though I now am awake for most of them (I just cannot speak or control my body), I am very confused. I cannot work, but it has more to do with my anxiety, schizoaffective disorder and the side effects of all the medications I take, including the anti-convulsants.\n\nLike you, I went to therapy and have been in trauma therapy for over 3 years now - I will still have a seizure if I go off the medications.\n\nAfter YEARS of going to see neurologists (only ONE suggested I had a ""mimic"") I finally stopped because it didn't matter WHY I have the seizures: I simply HAVE them and I want them to go away. I  have not been to a neurologist since 2018. I go see another one tomorrow in fact, but mostly for an acoustic neuroma and other, new symptoms like Parkinson's like shaking of my limbs and strange ocular symptoms (I worked 33 years in ophthalmology and know this is neurological in nature and not structural.\n\nAnyhow, I am very sorry you suffer seizures.

Recommend starting with 1-2 times a week, build up more frequently, if desired. Change up the exercises. But go for 5 different ones, keeps the flavour and creativity alive. \n\nBeing able to safely conduct exercises and adapt to your ability each day is essential.

h3pvr03,obloho,"That sounds very similar to my events.  I was diagnosed with PNES in late 2015.  Epilepsy was definitively ruled out.  I was also diagnosed with Complex PTSD shortly after.  \n\nMy PNES events present as dissociative blackouts.  Whatever I'm doing when one starts, I keep doing.  I still fun, but they say I am very confused.  I don't form memories during this time, as if the hippocampus in each side of my brain stops working.  The longest event I've had was 45 minutes.  They are usually between 2 and 10 minutes, and it takes about 7 minutes for confusion to clear afterward. \n\nThere's also a thing called Transient Global Amnesia you might want to look up.",1625168097,t3_obloho,/r/PNESsupport/comments/obloho/deleted_by_user/h3pvr03/

h36fm7c,o7m3b7,"Personally I go by the spoons method. Give yourself a specific amount of (metaphorical) spoons a day I use 12, you can use 40 if you want.  And each task you do in a day uses a specific amount of spoons. Waking up (1 spoon) showering (two spoons), work (4 spoons), shopping (2.5) etc.\n\nThen you have the seizures. Those can take up anywhere from 0.5 spoons to 8 spoons depending on how bad they are.  \n\nWhat I do is determine how many spoons I have left and how much is left to do. Sometimes there just is not enough spoons and it's okay. \n\nTry to regain some spoons by regaining some electrolytes, drink some water and breath. If within 30-60 minutes you still feel like you don't have enough spoons then today just is not the day to do the thing.\n\nAs for the feelings of dread and anxiety, making lists of what you can do in the moment, before or after seizures and even what others can do during and post them around the house in easy to access places.\n\nI learned this from a WRAP (Wellness Recovery Action Plan) class. https://mentalhealthrecovery.com/",1624766629,t3_o7m3b7,/r/PNESsupport/comments/o7m3b7/how_to_differentiate_between_excuse_making_and/h36fm7c/

Things that have helped me is looking at what are my priorities, giving myself a break to rest, and not spending too much time (2-8hrs) doing the same thing. \n\nFrom my experience, PNES takes a toll on my physical strength the most because even after resting I still feel exhausted. I list 3 things I have the ability to work on each day while making sure it will not take me 2-8 hours. If it does then I designate 1 whole day to do that 1 thing.

h2in0rr,o4p5c3,"So there are basically four types of seizures;\n\nTONIC-CLONIC SEIZURES¬†Previously known as grand mal seizures, tonic-clonic seizures are generalized. Sometimes a person with this type of epilepsy will experience an ""aura,"" or warning, before the seizure begins. During the tonic phase, a person typically stiffens and falls to the ground unconscious. The clonic phase begins with strong, rhythmic shaking movements. Drooling and loss of bladder or bowel control may occur. The seizure normally stops after a minute or two.\n\nABSENCE SEIZURES¬†These seizures, also called petit mal, are more common in children and are sometimes mistaken for daydreaming. Like tonic-clonic seizures, they are generalized but are milder. People experiencing this type of seizure lose awareness of what is happening around them, but they rarely fall to the ground. Their eyes may roll back, they may stare, or their eyelids may flutter. Absence seizures typically start suddenly, last a few seconds, and then stop suddenly.\n\nSIMPLE PARTIAL SEIZURES¬†These seizures involve only one part of the brain. Symptoms will vary depending on which part of the brain is involved. Unlike tonic-clonic and absence seizures, people experiencing simple partial seizures remain fully conscious. Common symptoms include stiffness or shaking in one part of the body or an abnormal feeling such as numbness or an unpleasant smell or taste. Simple partial seizures usually last for less than a minute.\n\nCOMPLEX PARTIAL SEIZURES¬†These are the most common seizure type. They involve only one part of the brain, but the person's conscious state is altered. He or she may appear confused and do unusual things like make sounds, fiddle with clothing, or make chewing movements. Complex partial seizures only last for one to two minutes.\n\n(Source: https://www.brainandlife.org/articles/the-seizures-no-one-wants-to-talk-about/)\n\nI experience both simple and complex partial seizures. There isn't much we can do about them (that I know) other than try to memorize Pi or maladaptive daydream until it's over.",1624264130,t3_o4p5c3,/r/PNESsupport/comments/o4p5c3/tongue/h2in0rr/

h039e1l,novck3,"Honestly there's no one thing you can look at with a seizure and say for certain it's PNES or Epileptic. Both seizure types have a huge range of presentations that overlap and  you wouldn't want to rule out one or the other without an EEG.  From my understanding and experience PNES I'm alert and able to communicate (to some extent) during the seizure and  my eyes are open but I know often PNES cause people to close their eyes. The PNES diagnosis was only made ater capturing the seizure on an EEG and confirming there were no ""Epileptic forms"" present. Before the EEG my neurologist was fairly certain it was epilepsy from what I described as the symptoms. I guess my point is that you want the hard evidence the seizures are not epileptic before getting the PNES diagnosis to avoid not treating the damaging effects of an epileptic seizure. \n\n\n\nIt's also common for women to have increased seizure frequency around their periods because of hormone changes. Your daughter has the added bonus of  being a teenager and having even more erratic hormones.\n\n \n\n It's not uncommon for people with epilepsy to also have PNES, considering how traumatic and unpredictable epileptic seizure can be. Therapy is what's used to treat PNES and probably would be beneficial even without that diagnosis.",1622474745,t3_novck3,/r/PNESsupport/comments/novck3/is_this_pnes_or_epileptic_seizure/h039e1l/

h028udn,novck3,"So sorry you are both going through this. I hope you find the right therapy as soon as possible. \n\nTo rule out epilepsy you'd most likely want to do an EEG. After that, the doctor will prescribe meds. If they take a chunk out of the seizures, your seizures will be electrical in nature, i.e. epilepsy. If they don't they can either be epilepsy or PNES. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy will help either way.\n\nGetting the right diagnosis isn't easy. I honestly can't help except offer assurance and confidence that there is a way out and healing is possible. It's great that you're helping your daughter so much, and keep trying to capture the episodes on video.\n\nI wish I could offer more to help.\n\nDepending on where you live, it might help to quickly call an ambulance after the next seizure. They'll arrive quickly and will do blood tests on the way to the hospital. There is a 20 minute time window where you can read elevated levels in the blood. It's actually how I was properly diagnosed.\n\nAfter decades of ping-ponging back and forth from specialist to specialist I had a big seizure. Wife called the ambulance. I woke up heading to the hospital at 2am. They did an amazing job. I stay in hospital for a week or so, did every test under the sun and they concluded, once and for all, it is not epilepsy. I did two years of CBT therapy and my seizures went from 50 to about 10 or so.\n\nNow it will depend on your health system and the costs but it was just an idea that happened to work for me.",1622448331,t1_h0270fx,/r/PNESsupport/comments/novck3/is_this_pnes_or_epileptic_seizure/h028udn/

gsstygq,mgcyzb,"Distance in time between when your trauma took place, and when you had your first ‚Äúseizure‚Äù is not unusual.  Let‚Äôs look at anxiety as if it was water in a pool.  Normally, the water is up to your knees.  Then your trauma happened, and now the water is up to your chest.  It‚Äôs more difficult to move, but you can still breathe, so you‚Äôre ‚Äúfine‚Äù.  Life adds small stresses/anxieties all the time, but you try to ignore them, as long as you can still breathe.  Eventually, you reach the tipping point.  You suddenly realize you‚Äôre drowning, and you have your first PNES event.  \n\nI was diagnosed with PNES in my fifties (2015).   Talk about ‚Äúlost‚Äù, how could my brain betray me like that?  But really, my brain coped for quite a long time before it just couldn‚Äôt anymore.\n\nMy ‚Äúseizures‚Äù don‚Äôt look like epilepsy at all.  They are blackouts.  I stop forming memory, so to me it feels like I cease to exist for several minutes (that was scary at first).  When it ends, I‚Äôm confused, and it takes 10 to 20 minutes to fully recover and get all my memory back.  Everyone tells me that when I‚Äôm ‚Äúout‚Äù, I‚Äôm still me, just confused and with holes in my memory.  Weird.\n\nI got a sleep study done right after my diagnosis, which revealed a couple sleep disorders plus apnea.  Since being treated for those, my sleep is MUCH better, and the frequency of PNES events dropped.  Although trauma is a main cause of PNES, sleep deprivation is a big contributor, so you might want to check that.\n\nI still needed to deal with the trauma of my childhood, though, so in Aug of 2019 I started therapy and was diagnosed with Complex PTSD.  I chose EMDR therapy, because it is very effective for C-PTSD, and unlike talk therapy, it doesn‚Äôt go on indefinitely.  That appealed to me.  I can‚Äôt say it was easy...in fact, it was often brutal.  But it worked!   After 20 months of therapy, I had my final session yesterday.  I no longer have C-PTSD.  \n\nI don‚Äôt know if my PNES events will go away completely.  It has a very poor cure rate in adults.

gsnqq7b,mfg9vf,"Stress for me is the number one factor. The problem is, identifying stressors correctly and dealing with them in time. I've noticed with my seizures that stress can build up and a seizure will be the body's way of releasing it. This usually comes when I'm relaxing, not when I'm stressed out or under pressure.\n\nSo your observation is correct. There are days or weeks with little stress and past stress will catch up with you.\n\nWhat does this mean and how can you learn to control it?\n\nDo an ""inventory"" of your stress every few hours or so. Close your eyes, take a deep breath, and truly look within yourself and how you are feeling in that moment. Imagine a pot, and a scale from 1 to 6. At 6, the lid is flying off and at 1 you are completely calm. Put a number to the amount of stress you are having and actively work to reduce that. (meditate, get a massage, sleep). Do this even if you think you are not stressed!\n\nThis technique helped me reduce my seizures from 50 a year to about 11-12 a year. YMMV but it's worth a try.

gncfv2c,ljdnno,Peppermint essential oil helps with muscle tension. \n\nAlso Caffeine is a biiig Nono for PNES sufferers. Caffeine adds to your nervous energy or stress and that will trigger seizures and panic attacks. \n\nSo most likely you are having a stress headache from your muscles being too tight. Try and do some research on pressure points. There are a few in the fingers to help with stress headaches. \n\nBetween the pointer and thumb massage the nerve there to the point you feel a pinch. It should cause a decrease in headache pain and it tingles up your neck. \nAnother is pinch the first joint of the middle finger on its sides and massage there. Finally the outside of your pinky had another. \n\nYou can also look straight ahead and the. Push your chin back towards your neck.

gn78did,liyrcw,"I have not been officially diagnosed. I was given the diagnosis of epilepsy in 2009 when I had my first gran mal seizure at age 43. I woke up handcuffed to a stretcher and my tongue half bitten off. (I was handcuffed because I apparently fought HARD when I woke up). I had another seizure in the hospital nd SUPPOSEDLY while on an EEG and some blip showed up. Since that day, I have had normal EEGS. The first 5 years or so after that first one, I had a seizure a month. Then my seizures started to change.\n\nI had auras with the last ones, but these, I only got a ""feeling"" something was going to happen. I started to shake, then my left eye rolls back into my head, my left arm curls up and my left leg pulls up. I then start to shake, drool and make these yelping sounds (I cannot speak, but can hear what is going on around me. with the other kind, I was 100% unconscious and would have NO memory of the event.). The seizures last under or right around a minute. AT the end of them, I will cry and be very upset. I am pretty much back to normal...kinda...within a couple of hours. I have them 100% when I get stressed out, over-heated in high humidity and if I do not sleep, eat, get dehydrated, etc. I had a seizure having my left ear cleaned out last month. Only ONE out of the 7 neurologists I have seen since 2009 has suggested PNES (and only because of my history of PTSD, trauma and anxiety). I also have had 5 concussions and a mystery virus that caused me to have a 104 fever in college. He thought I may have BOTH PNES and epilepsy.\n\nPNES is not that common, from what I hear and the best diagnostic tool, so I have read, is a video EEG.\n\nI stopped going to the neurologists in 2016. One thing I did find out is that my seizures go away when I take STRONG medications to stop them......it is compliance that is an issue, (I have bipolar I and when manic, have problems being consistent taking the meds....even the psychiatric ones)\n\nAs for your situation, I would start with a neurologist. Have a loved one or friend take a video when you have your next seizure. THIS would be immensely helpful to any neurologist you see.

gnlmhb3,liyrcw,"It's unfortunately not uncommon to be brushed off, especially when other psychological conditions are present. I was admitted to the ER twice and diagnosed with panic attacks by doctors who were primarily interested in getting me tfo of their hospital  bed. Like, obviously y'all, I've had those since I was 18, I KNOW what a panic attack is, and this ain't it.\n\nPNES is typically diagnosed after a video EEG, so they can rule out any kind of epileptic seizures. My niece has epilepsy, and her doctors didn't catch it for a while, because her brain ALWAYS broadcasts epileptic activity. When I was receiving my video EEG, I learned about a lot of different kinds of seizures, and how wildly they can behave. I had my treatment at Cleveland Clinic and their epilepsy ward ends up diagnosing about 40% of their patients with PNES. So, relatively common among seizure sufferers, it's just that there's not a lot of research being done about it, and awareness about PNES is really bad among healthcare providers. \n\nThat EEG is also not going to be the end of your journey, there are a lot of steps in getting diagnosed. For me it was an EEG, ambulatory EEG, EMG and an MRI, then all of that again after my first neurologist shrugged and shoo'd me out the door. Then FINALLY the video EEG. I'm not gonna lie, it's not fun. But answers are important, especially if you have multiple conditions. \n\nMy best advice is to continue advocating for yourself. That is SO important. If the neurologist you're seeing isn't aware of PNES or open to learning about it, then it's time to find a new one. It's my personal experience that female doctors are more sympathetic and willing to listen, but any doctor that is a giant nerd about their field of study is a great sign. If they're engaged, take detailed notes, and inform you about the tests they're running, they're probably cool.

gkv0xdk,l0oue2,"Hello!  Your story is so familiar!  So I grew up with terrible migraines as a kid, my mother and grandmother have/had them as well, but I grew out of them in my twenties and then they started returning about 5 years ago.  I started seeing a neurologist for them because they had weird, very personal and intimate triggers.  And then about 2 years ago I was hospitalized for what looked like a stroke, but they never found any structural abnormalities.\n\nOn and off I would have smaller ""events"" and occasionally larger ""episodes"" where I would experience the whole facial drooping and temporary left side paralysis, but then COVID-19 hit and of course I was at high risk because like you I am type 2 diabetic and I was already dealing with one of those fungal infections that only us T2D's get and I was ordered to stay home because respiratory disease on top of that is no bueno, and of course all the testing stopped.\n\nThen I had a series of 3 to 5 big seizures in a row in one day back in July.  Like you I had an epileptic friend that knew what they were, had kinda identified them to me before hand, but I didn't really believe her, but after the first one my wife called an ambulance, then I had another in the ambulance and they kept on coming.  Only after the hospital told me ""dude, you are having seizures"" did I really believe it.  Forced my neurologist's hand, he ordered the big 5 hour epilepsy test.  They confirmed it wasn't epilepsy, but were able to intentionally trigger one of my full facial meltdown seizures on camera with the hyperventilation test (please do not do this at home, is not a fun party trick), and while it took me 2 weeks to recover from it, I've never been so happy to have a seizure in my life!\n\nThing is, I've never really liked my neurologist.  I'm Canadian, so yeah, good news is my taxes give me access to a neurologist, but I don't get to be picky.  But the moment he saw the results he flipped around.  He doesn't use the term PNES, which made it super hard for me to find this group, he actually uses all the British literature on this instead, and he is treating the pain and paralysis and migraines as if they are the underlying cause still.  Dissasociative Seizures was what he called them, and we are looking into Hemiplegic Migraines as the underlying cause of the pain, although it's not a perfect fit.\n\nThis is all new for me, although I guess I've been living with this and dealing with this for a while now.  The pain is a lot.  I've lost the use of half my body right now.  But yeah, don't let someone dismiss the symptom for a cause.  I'm surprised as anyone to find that my neurologist is actually on my side on this one.",1611691183,t3_l0oue2,/r/PNESsupport/comments/l0oue2/deleted_by_user/gkv0xdk/

gjsc9x0,kzuyzs,"My seizures started when I was at high school. I was getting several seizures a day, and was just dropping to the floor and down the stairs more than I care to admit (lots of bruises, concussions etc.). After over a year I started getting warnings sometimes, when I got a warning I would go to the nearest empty room and sit on the floor, a teacher would sit with me.\n\nMy depute head asked me to leave the school because 'I wasn't suited to the environment, and wasn't likely to succeed'. I had a few teachers that were very negative, and sometimes outright horrible about my seizures. I had one that made a joke of me infront of the class, this same teacher used me as a impromptu hands on first aid session for the class. Most of my teachers were lovely and completely accommodating once I explained my situation and how I'd like it handled (a doctors letter eased there worries). Some teachers insisted someone came with me to the bathroom, and walked me to my next class.\n\nOur school didn't have a nurse, only first aiders, protocol for my seizures was for the teacher or a free teacher (I had a list of female teachers I was ok with), would look after me, however if my seizure lasted more than 10min a first aider was called. However one of my teachers in particular wouldn't follow this and would simply leave me alone.\n\nFor class tests and exams I had a seperate room and someone (invigilator/teacher) in the room with me. \n\nI have now learned to pick up on my more subtle warnings, which has meant I haven't had a seizure without warning in almost 3years, although I still have several a day.\n\nI didn't go to university because of my seizures, so wasn't able to follow my dreams. I don't really regret that, because I have the most amazing job (supporting pupils at my old high school) and incredibly supportive colleagues which I would swap for the world.

Andrew Johnson has many apps meant to be used either for sleep or for awake so you can put on his track before sleep and just fall asleep while he keeps your subconscious distracted with positive messages.

gga0k75,kfnj5q,"Wow.  Lots to address here.  Prepare for wall of text.  In June 2015, I started having episodes, which docs assumed was epilepsy.  I was put on Keppra, which didn‚Äôt help; event frequency increased.  After months of doctors (neurologist, epileptologist, and psychologist), medical tests, increased Keppra, and the implosion of my life, I was finally diagosed with PNES.  One contributing cause was sleep disorders which caused decades of sleep deprivation (insomnia, dreaming in non-rem stages, lack of circadian rhythm).  Another cause was sleep apnea.  Another was chronic pain from joint problems and myelin deficiency (which causes misfiring nerves, sending pain/burning impulses to my brain every few minutes).  Stress put me over the edge, but the biggest cause was Complex PTSD.  Let‚Äôs just say I had an interesting childhood.  \n\nI was taken off Keppra.  I was put on Amitriptyline nightly, which helps me fall sleep and stay asleep (no more waking 8 times each night, struggling to fall asleep again).  It also helps a bit with pain and anxiety, too.  Being able to sleep every night was amazing!  Then I got my cpap machine, and my dreaming calmed down (still vivid and too often, but better).  I am better oxygenated, too.   My memory has improved, and my thinking is so much clearer (before treatment, I really thought I had dementia), and I started going a couple months between PNES events\n\nTreating the C-PTSD is a much slower and harder process.  In August of 2019, I started EMDR therapy.  This has made the biggest difference to me personally, but I would not have been capable of doing it had I not treated the other conditions first.  I am told that my PNES events will likely stop when I‚Äôve finished EMDR therapy.  I hope so.\n\nSo, you‚Äôve already addressed his sleep disorders.  Good.  Keep on top of that.  I have been told by a neurologist, my GP, and my therapist to sleep as much as possible.  Naps ae your friend.  Anxiety & stress are definitely event triggers.  Your dad may need an anti-anxiety med.  Yoga also helps.  Seriously, it‚Äôs surprising how much.    Also, if he has chronic pain, he needs help for that.\n\nLastly, PNES is very often caused by PTSD and sexual abuse.  Do you know if he has that history?  This is a very uncomfortable conversation for parent and child, so might be best brought up by your mom.

We just recognized last week that they are PNES after I almost didn't come back. \n\nI second that there is a lot to address so prepare yourself for a wall, I'm going to ignore my gut feeling of wanting to apologise for it lol. Talking about this helps me so much and taking the time to make this wall makes my heart heal. \n\nI'm going to start the wall about treatment. I personally have just SERIOUSLY started because I just gained the motivation/determination/self-respect but I've been taking pills ever since I was in like second grade for all my weird brain stuff. \n\nNo one believes me about what's best for me. I can tell what treatment is going to help me mentally and I 1000% think that helping myself emotionally will help with my physical manifestations. I'm such an emotional person that it's scary. It's like it can't be turned off. I would ask your Dad about how often he feels anxiety, I noticed that my seizures have a very very direct correlation to how much panic I felt that day (and then I'll usually have them in my sleep that night). \n\nI've been on Keppra, multiple anti-depressants, anxiety meds, I think another 2 seizure meds as well? I don't really remember anymore, I kinda just took whatever someone handed me. The only one that I've personally noticed make a difference is Buspirone but it can take a while to help (I SWEAR I can feel it help within the hour though) I know that probably won't be helpful? But I just want to tell you my personal experience in case it DOES help. \n\nIf your dad feels anything like I do, all he wants is support but is too afraid to ask for it. It feels like if I speak up about how much worse everything is getting, about how much I realized others don't have to go through this and that I'm 'crazy' people will hate me. You have NO idea how much it means that you're willing to be there for him at all. When my MOTHER took care of me in the hospital I was WRACKED with guilt and still am. I ruined her life by being special. \n\nMy yearning for independence is way too strong to be disabled. I still don't even want to read the word. If you can, please sit down and just talk. Whenever you don't mind it. And if he looks anxious it really might be because he thinks you're judging him. I'm noticing new symptoms, s**t that's so in line with all of this but I'm going to have to grow the biggest pair to tell a doctor. But a friend? If I had a daughter or something? Probably would be a lot easier and knowing everything will help you be able to fix it. I think treating the symptoms (extreme back pain ALL the time, WAVES of extreme anxiety that causes me to be confused as heck, I don't know where I am a lot, etc etc etc.) \n\nI am so sorry. You don't deserve this, no one does. I don't want anyone to take care of me. But I'm worried I might need it someday.

ggaejaw,kfnj5q,"Thank you so much for your response! I appreciate you sharing your story and experiences. I think he needs to go back to his sleep specialist because he is waking more and having more night terrors/talking/ acting out his dreams, which for a while had stopped with medication, but now he is sleeping much more during the day and more restless at night. When I say this man is in almost a constant state of napping, I‚Äôm not kidding. He might have five or six active hours per day. Among the seizures being a reason he cannot drive, he also fell asleep while driving. I think the broken or restless sleep at night is not helping the situation. While I don‚Äôt want to do everything for him, and want him to be as active and self sufficient as possible, I don‚Äôt want to stress him out more and exacerbate the seizures. It‚Äôs a thin line to toe of helping or harming. What you said about it seeming like you had dementia before treatment really resonated with me because that‚Äôs what I think sometimes. He seems to forget things or just not think clearly even in minuscule tasks, which can be frustrating but I just try to break it down and get him to walk through the steps logically, or remind him of the things he has forgotten. I just saw the EMDR therapy today and will be looking into that more. Did it seem like you really had to be your own advocate to doctors? Literally every test that they have done is because I researched it myself and insisted they at least try. Most have been dead ends, but I figure leave no stone unturned.. but I am running out of suggestions or people to call.\n\nWith the recommendation for CBT and this being linked to PTSD was surprising to my family because my dad has never had issues with depression, anxiety, etc prior to these events. We have talked about things that could be triggering this, such as the death of his father from cancer, him getting the same cancer about 15 years later- his is in remission now, but he did say this worries him as it has been 15 years since his diagnosis and that is when his fathers cancer came back. I think that is definitely a stressor. My niece also passed away as a baby from SIDS about 10 years ago, and my dad admittedly said he never really processed these events, and rather just got back to work and ‚Äúdealt‚Äù with it the best he knew how. Do you think maybe since he is retired now and doesn‚Äôt have work to distract him that these things weigh heavier than he had thought? The primary reason I found it interesting that these events manifested into seizures is because he has never so much as had a panic attack, so it was surprising that there was no earlier warning signs and it just manifested in such an extreme way. Maybe the psychologist is the proper route to pursue, and I‚Äôm trying to find one locally who specializes in this since it has been three months since we have heard anything from the last doctor. I have been working with him on his physical therapy and taking walks, I am a huge advocate for yoga, mindfulness, and meditation but that is a tough sell to him sometimes and his body doesn‚Äôt quite allow for yoga yet. He gets so fired up about world happenings and Facebook, which I try to get him to limit because it definitely exacerbates his episodes.\n\nSorry, I know my original post and this follow up is a lot of word vomit, but it was a little cathartic to just get it out.. so thanks for listening to me.",1608322416,t1_gga0k75,/r/PNESsupport/comments/kfnj5q/pnes_newly_diagnosed_caretaker/ggaejaw/
ggc35vr,kfnj5q,"Prior to my first PNES event (which was misdiagnosed in the ER as Transient Global Amnesia), I thought I handled stress very well.  I believed that if you didn‚Äôt panic, didn‚Äôt shout at people, and nobody could see you were stressed, then you were handling it well.  In actuality, I was just stuffing it down and trying to keep moving forward, taking care of everyone else in my complicated and demanding life.  I never had a panic attack, so it never occurred to me that I had anxiety.  Must have been warning signs, but I didn‚Äôt see them.  I had started dissociating in childhood, and spent a lot of my adult life in that state, too.  My poor brain finally just had enough, and threw PNES at me to get my attention.  Objective achieved!  \n\nWhatever the multiple causes for your dad‚Äôs PNES, he can attack them one at a time, as long as he treats them all.  Sounds to me that you are definitely on the right track about his sleep issues.  Gotta get that under control first (my non-medical opinion).  Lack of proper sleep causes memory problems, can lower your pain threshold, lowers PNES event threshold, weakens the immune system, can trigger psychosis, etc.  Also makes you more prone to anxiety, so that‚Äôs not helpful. ü§® \n\nThen the trauma...   Your dad‚Äôs father dying of cancer = trauma.  His own battle with cancer = trauma.  Sudden death of grandkid = trauma.  And yes, you are probably right; since your dad is retired, he is likely thinking more often about his traumas.  Can‚Äôt use work to avoid dealing with them anymore.  And wondering how long his remission will last.  Hopefully forever, but it‚Äôs natural to worry.\n\nAs for doctors, I‚Äôve had some that were caring and wonderful and would stop at nothing to find answers and help.  I‚Äôve had some that thought they knew everything, and refused to listen to me, their patient.  I‚Äôve had only two in my life who didn‚Äôt care at all, and were only in it for the money.  In your role as caregiver, it is important that you ask all the questions you have.  In my experience, the good doctors will answer honestly, even if the answer is ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù.

My left eye will roll up into my head and my left hand will curl up into my body. I will start to tear up. I am conscious, but cannot speak.

I shake and spit for about a minute or a minute and a half...then it is over and I am bawling like a 4 year old that dropped their ice cream cone.\n\nWith the other seizures, I am out the entire day and for the next two weeks after the seizure, I am ""different""\n\nI smell things, (mostly dog poop or herbal smells), see things flit by at the side of my vision (NOT floaters, I worked in retina for years and know what those look like) and I will STUTTER.\n\nThe second kind of seizure I have many times a month or sometimes not in a month at all.

gft1qi5,k91q5p,I see T. V. static 24/7 everywhere I look. I‚Äôve been told by an eye doctor that this is from pressure behind my eyes due to stress. It was one of my first symptoms. \nGrade 11 (when you‚Äôre 16-17) I barely remember. I was in a constant state of mind numbing dissociation that never went away. My brain hurts but is numb most of the time. \nWhen they first started with me my brain would go numb my temperature would go up alarmingly my eyes would glaze over and I‚Äôd become completely unresponsive. I‚Äôd be like this for anywhere between 5-15 minutes. The recovery period was worse than the seizures oftentimes as I‚Äôd go into mild shock from sudden temperatures changing. \nI tend to have what are called absent seizures where your body freezes up and your connection to the controls to your body are severed. I‚Äôve been like this for 20 years now. I have managed to work at points in my life but usually I can‚Äôt keep a job because of PNES.

gcwytew,jwmyof,Well since PNES is called such because our anxiety causes seizures. It‚Äôs no surprise you also have a tick. I will also point out that for MANY of us the TRIGGER for the seizure or ticks is not something readily apparent and we don‚Äôt have the seizure or ticks happen in the moment. For example I could have a trigger happen (ie a stranger walked up and chatted with me.) in the moment I would feel I handled myself all right and did not particularly feel any real stress. But subconsciously my mind is screaming and keeps screaming without me realizing it for a week before I have the actual seizure. \nSo most likely even though you don‚Äôt FEEL stressed the ticks are a sign of stress and also a warning to the upcoming seizure.,1605850461,t3_jwmyof,/r/PNESsupport/comments/jwmyof/head_tics/gcwytew/

geb5u5l,jk5g47,Fighting it can (as you noticed) make it worse. Just find someplace comfortable and let it happen. \n\nWhen I‚Äôm having a seizure I come out of it faster if someone I trust is with me and holding my hand talking softly to me. This is because PNES is a stress disorder and something that reduces stress helps in small ways. That could be why talking to certain people helps you avoid the seizure because your stress drops. \n\nMy seizures also las for a long time and the recovery time is usually at least an hour before I‚Äôm back to normal. \n\nGet a neurologist to confirm and then get yourself a trauma therapist to help you manage the overwhelming stress that is causing the seizures. \n\nThis isn‚Äôt the end of the world to have this condition it just means you have to plan for more when you go out and having a trusted person with you for when you have a seizure is really helpful as they can help you and manage the onlookers who might panic.,1606863518,t3_jk5g47,/r/PNESsupport/comments/jk5g47/well_this_sucks/geb5u5l/

Having her mom come take care of her when I work so I don‚Äôt have to worry helps too. \n\nOtherwise mindfulness. Deep breaths. Sometimes having a good cry.

I‚Äôve suffered from CPTSD since my early teens. That comes along with anxiety and depression. I never realized that I was dissociating all those years to cope with my emotions and bad things that were happening. I never was taught healthy coping skills, just to bury everything. But eventually it became too much and I started having seizures and neurological deficits from all of the trauma. \n\nI‚Äôm working on my masters in neurobiology and my understanding of it is that your fight-or-flight system (limbic system) gets switched to always being on. There is a third option in there, which is freeze. I freeze when I‚Äôm threatened out of terror and then I dissociate from reality because it‚Äôs too much. So this mechanism in my brain is faulty. The brain changes because of experiences. So when your limbic system is always in fight-or-flight mode, those connections get stronger and stronger and weird things start to happen, like dissociation and seizures. There is a way to rewire your brain. I meditate nearly every day because meditation strengthens your orbital medial prefrontal cortex (OMPFC). This part of your brain modulates your limbic system and it‚Äôs the part that makes rational decisions. So when your limbic system turns on, your OMPFC turns off. So ideally, if you can strengthen the part of your brain that counteracts your wonky limbic system then it will stop going crazy all the time. Plus meditation is good for relaxation. \n\nAlong with that, I needed to go to serious therapy to deal with all the trauma I‚Äôve been through and learn healthy coping and communication skills. Overall I‚Äôve stopped having seizures, though I‚Äôve found that my family is my main trigger so I‚Äôve stopped talking to them mostly. Stress triggers them too, but if it‚Äôs neutral I‚Äôm much more able to find solutions and handle it. I‚Äôm not able to work currently because I get overwhelmed and exhausted easily. I‚Äôm still going to school part time and living off school loans while I get everything under control. I worry about doing that but the research regarding NES has shown that once people go on disability they are much less likely to stop having seizures because they essentially give up. This is obviously not true for everyone though and sometimes you have no other choice. I was lucky and in my area there is a research treatment program for people with NES to understand what it is and learn coping skills. I‚Äôd definitely recommend looking around for something like that in your area, though it may not exist. But from the other people that were in the treatment program with me, I definitely found that therapy is a must. I‚Äôve also been looking into getting an emotional support dog. I‚Äôve found that dogs help keep me calm and I‚Äôm able to do so many more normal things. My hope is that by the time I graduate this summer I‚Äôll be at a place where I can work and be a contributing member of society. \n\nI don‚Äôt know if any of this helps you at all, it‚Äôs just what helped me. Everyone is different. But I do wish you so much luck. Be kind to yourself. It‚Äôs what I struggle with the most. We all deserve kindness and love. I know it‚Äôs awful and scary right now and everything to get through this is difficult. But it doesn‚Äôt have to mean the end of everything. With the right help, it hopefully just means it‚Äôs a really big hill you have to climb, but you can get over it. Also, if you‚Äôre looking for a good book, I‚Äôd recommend The Body Keeps the Score.

fd67v1i,ejxijj,"I haven't read everything because it's triggering for me. What helped me with my PNES was seeing a psychologist who specializes in psycho neurological behavior. We worked on mindfulness, meditation, daily breathing exercises that have been proven to be effective in retraining your brain, positive acceptance, and really getting my mind and body connected.\n\nI really wasn't a fan of the psychologist but it worked. I've been seizure free for close to a year. I find the techniques he taught me to be good for my anxiety, too. I've added them to my toolbox.\n\nI regret not getting into therapy when I was your age. I had a traumatic childhood and it could have made such a difference in my young life and could have kept me from developing dysautonomia, and later PNES.

fd47bux,ejxijj,That‚Äôs a great start! I‚Äôm so happy for you. It‚Äôs great that you already have support in place and that you have a fianc√© who is helping you as much as he can. Though that‚Äôs really hard with the accident. Hopefully he‚Äôs ok. I don‚Äôt know if I would have gotten as far as I have without my boyfriend helping me. \n\nI struggle with school too. It‚Äôs hard. I used to go full time and teach and do research and now I can‚Äôt do all of that. I found that cutting down the number of classes helped me. I also went to the disability resources office at school and got it set up with accommodations so I can turn in assignments late and I may miss classes more frequently. I rarely use it. Mostly there are some days I just can‚Äôt make it to campus. But that took some pressure off. I‚Äôve had to lower my expectations of myself a lot because the more pressure I put on myself the harder things become for me. I wish there were easy solutions to everything and there were a switch we can flip and magically be better. \n\nI got my medical ID bracelet off of amazon for like $14.

fdfjxgf,ejxijj,"Canaderar, Good idea about the Amazon bracelet, I'll have to look into that. \n\nI've also been scared to look into disability financing due to my own stigma, potential stigma from others and fear I'm taking resources away from others. \n\nLike both you and OP, my partner has been essential in my coping and self care. Unfortunately this is a double edged sword as they're now not only my partner, but my carer, and I take my frustration out on them when they can't figure out what I need when I can't talk/write/move which in turn means they are at times a trigger.\n\nI'm really impressed that both of you chose to tough it out at school.\n\nPersonally I'm in an extremely rural area (there is nowhere I could walk or bike to within an hour). Getting to doctors, psychologists etc was extremely stressful and therefore flared up my symptoms to the point that whatever help they provided, beyond diagnosis, was cancelled out by the stress of getting to them so I stopped treatment.\n\nTo OP, I also have chronic depression from childhood, I think that's common to pnes along with sexual trauma. I also have the freezing, collapsing, altered speech or muteness, and I used to have the clonic tonic seizures but now it more manifests as weak limbs (dragging my legs because I can't pick them up).\n\nTriggers are hard and even with multiple professionals I haven't found anything clear with regards to specific memories/events/emotions. The most common ones are bright lights which are also triggers to my migraines, walking through doorways often makes me collapse, and anything that increases my heartrate : happiness, distress, working out etc. I also at times can't breathe- it makes me cry when it's prolonged and I feel like I'm going to faint but sometimes I can just accept it and pretend I'm holding my breath while swimming under water, but at times it hurts and it feels like someone is choking me.\n\nI'm very grateful I've never blacked out or lost time and I'm sorry to hear you have to deal with that.\n\nI lost my driver's license immediately. This has made me angry over my dependence on others to get anywhere and my anger when my partner doesn't want to take me where I want to go (they have social anxiety). Being rural, we don't have garbage pick up and have to take our bags to the dump. I've checked and there's no grocery store willing to deliver groceries. So in the summer I had to deal with little food and stinky piles of garbage but I've adjusted to buying an excessive amount of cans and planning for a couple weeks of groceries ahead of time; soup recipes are essential in my life now.\n\nAnyways, all that was ranting about myself, sorry. I find since my diagnosis, it's very hard to not constantly be introspective, self-analytical, and self hating more than usual.\n\nI wish you the best of luck with your progress towards being symptom free and autonamous.\n\nToday I found a little nugget of inspiration for dealing with depression and focusing on who you're putting the work of dealing with your present and past self in for: your future self.\n\nPlease read the first comment on this thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q96b5/comment/cdah4af\n\nBest of luck, thanks for reading",1578363448,t1_fd47bux,/r/PNESsupport/comments/ejxijj/yee_haw_im_worried/fdfjxgf/

But I am in grad school and I try to go to campus at least once a week and do the work and give presentations. I did my proposal defense and there were a few times I slurred and had trouble talking but I made it through and passed. I‚Äôve found that the more I go out and do stuff the easier it becomes. I think we get this fear of having a seizure in public, and it is really scary and people sometimes freak out when it happens, and we let that fear hold us back. But I take the bus all over the place and it was terrifying at first. I‚Äôve had to find coping mechanisms for if I get overwhelmed, like focusing on my breathing and grounding myself in my body. Music helps too. If it‚Äôs too much then I have a plan to get off the bus and try to calm down. I have a backpack to put under my head and I will call a Lyft if necessary. So far it‚Äôs never been necessary luckily because I have my plan and I know when I‚Äôm getting overwhelmed and in danger of having one. I meditate daily. I still have seizures, though the frequency has decreased. I don‚Äôt know what your situation is like, but my experience is that having a plan to stay safe while still living life as normal as possible is the best thing you can do for yourself. And if it‚Äôs something you‚Äôre worried about, then have a friend or family member do trial runs on the bus with you or being at a place you would want to work. See how you handle it and if you can get used to it. I just tell myself that these situations are just an opportunity for me to practice at handling things better and it makes it a little less scary. I don‚Äôt know if that helps, but I know how sitting stuck at home everyday just makes things harder and more heartbreaking. I hope you do find a way so you can have fulfilling days that make you feel good about yourself. You deserve it. \n\nI wish I had any advice about what to do about jobs. I‚Äôve been worried about that when I finally graduate. Maybe you can find government disability resources for your state and see what laws there are, if any, that protect you and if they have any advice or anything that can help you find a job where you will feel safe and secure?

Things have been hard, but I have excellent coping skills. \n\nThe idea that these episodes are only caused by emotional trauma is ludicrous, and a cop-out by neurologists who simply don‚Äôt know yet what‚Äôs going on. \n\nI plan on having my hormones tested too.

Now I get to be a stay at home mom with a ton of support and I have a seizure alert dog who is my best buddy (and is super helpful)- but I‚Äôm a person that handles stress immensely well when I‚Äôm in it. I‚Äôve always found avenues. I‚Äôm not a person who worries about the things I can‚Äôt change and I take care of what I can and move on. I‚Äôve tried doing grounding exercises and I meditate every day and do yoga and still have seizures. I‚Äôve been to therapy previously in life and still use those tools I learned - I‚Äôm not buying that there‚Äôs absolutely nothing physically wrong with me. I have an ambulatory EEG this week and an MRA next month then another neuro appt set up for January. I‚Äôm on Keppra and lamictal.

As an outsider, with the little information I have, I would suggest some form of therapy to deal with the depression first.\n\nIf the seizures are psychogenic, therapy can help to reduce the frequency or severity. A neurologist should rule our epilepsy as well.\n\nThe second issue is the Disassociative Identity Disorder, which I cannot comment on, unfortunately. By the sounds of it, it's all linked together. \n\nThe good news is, it's just temporary and can be fixed, even though it doesn't seem like it.

So in humble opinion, it was better for me to find someone I could gel with than a knowledgeable specialist in the field of PNES. \n\nI believe most therapists follow a standard protocol anyway. CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) really is about how your deal with traumas today as opposed to analysing the why and how. So if she has good and bad days, we can work on expanding the good ones.\n\nTo me, PNES is like spaghetti.

fb8tzff,dt699m,"Thanks for your words of support, quite often close friends ask is there anything they can do, just to listen and understand is more than enough. I thought no-one would respond with this thread, but glad I posted now. Others have asked me how I can carry such a burden. I have never felt this as a burden, I realised when you love someone and do something for them it never feels like work, and somehow automatically the energy to do tasks is there. I'm not saying it hasn't been frustrating, but I have learned a lot. Since my wife's last major suicide attempt (she jumped from a bridge near the house, miracle she survived, ICU for several days, had drowned and under for 10mins) we wondered about brain damage and initial prognosis was none. But even since she's had this paranoia. And in the beginning we'd have huge arguments about it while tried to convince her of the opposite. The most intense event her strong personality came out and tried to hurt her, one thing about her she will never hurt anyone else when she has a psychotic event and just tries to hurt herself and drawing blood gives her some relief from what she's told me. Quite often these events are intertwined with hallucinations that everything around her is breaking and falling apart. Anyway now when she initiates that stuff I notice it's usually post something stressful, like dealing with our Son's abhorrent behaviour. So I try to make light of it, or try to accept it. Anyhow I persist and want to see her feel better, have more self esteem and learn to love herself. These are serious challenges for her, the biggest is accepting that she has value. I think most types of depression stem from a lack of self esteem or belief in self worth.",1576621841,t1_fb8hd8s,/r/PNESsupport/comments/dt699m/disassociation_and_pnes/fb8tzff/

fb9ygg7,dt699m,"I talk to my cousin now and again, my son and daughter both require therapy, they are actually my step children from the wife's first marriage. The first marriage where all the trauma is from. She was tortured physically and mentally for 12 years. We married after her divorce I met her when she was separated and living with her brother. I took the kids to counselling when they were much younger. But my son went through 4 different counsellors they mostly gave up on him and suggested ADHD meds. My wife said she never would allow it, being on medication for the rest of her life she didn't want that for him. The last counsellor he had actually was beginning to make progress a really patient lady, however after 3 months she moved to a different place. Anyway since we have tried to manage him ourselves. But my wife loves him but can't deal with his problems and mostly let's it wash over because she can't deal with loosing him. Although I know that won't happen and he just needs to learn to appreciate what he has. But I understand where it all comes from, she basically protected them they suffered together, the bond is very strong, but it's also the cause of most of her anxiety. I can't even begin to suggest counselling to him he's 23 and my daughter is 25. She is willing but my son will never accept he has anger management problems. There is so much more If I had to write it all down I would never have the time. So many events. We have been married now for 15 years. I think I am like a tank, I'm thick skinned and highly tolerant. I had to deal with alot growing up, my parents and all they went through, then school were I dealt with racism on a different level. I was the only East Indian in an all boys school. I learned to adapt survive and be tolerant. I get my vice's here and there. But most of all, when my wife is happy or having a good day I feel like all my problems don't exist. I feel the happiest when I she is getting on with life and being the happy flower she used to be before she was forced into an arranged marriage at 18. I see that spark sometimes and it's what keeps me going. Like she was doing well past few days, however both of my kids are leaving in the morning to visit there cousins in UK. And she helped them both pack and then I could see the anxiety starting to creep in, the deep sighing of worry. They're going for 3 weeks. So I know her head is doing all kinds of worry somersaults. She told me she had to get out of the house she gone to visit her Freind who has three small kids, she's gone because being around small children calms her down makes her happy. Plus she cares.

I like how you dealt with it and how it made you more resilient. In the end, the racism said more about them than it did about you anyway :-)\n\nI can't really comment more than I can listen. But if I'm allowed to be blunt, judging from your comments, it's you that's holding a lot of it together. A support system for you, redundancy, would probably help a lot.

fbbm6xd,dt699m,"Yeah it's difficult to have a support system, my own anxiety about my wife doesn't leave me much space to build that network. Besides most people don't have the unlimited patience to deal with everything that's going on my life. I come to the brink of frustration on occasion and take it out on inanimate objects. Or try to channel my aggression somehow. My biggest problem to having a more successful approach is the same problem we all have... MONEY can't make enough of it, kids work but they don't contribute and I can't force them too. Especially not my daughter she is getting started still and only works part time as a fitness instructor. But my son.... I gave him my ticket to never having to worry about money. I was given a referral for a casual job with exceptional pay. But my wife and brother-in-law convinced me to give it to him because he barely graduated high school, and had problems holding down a regular job. He quite changed jobs due to conflict. However he now has the ability to make close to six figures in a manual role. I'm skilled and university educated but he can make more money than me. And I struggle to make ends meet. Because it's casual he takes full advantage to work only when he runs short of cash. He was given it too soon, he has no respect for what he has been given because he hasn't earned it. Hasn't had to grind and work and to get there. But off I got on another rant. I have learned to accept that my life will be and continue to be a struggle. Many years ago I heard the poem from Kalil Gibran called ""The River"" which identifies how life may be a struggle for some and free of blockades for another, but we all terminate to the same end. However as I have said before I take the happiness where I can find it, and latch on to the good experiences.

f5u6ln2,dpb8ob,"hello and welcome to our small corner of the world. It can be a scary place but there are many people here who care and are more than happy to answer your questions. \n\nI myself was only diagnosed officially with General Anxiety Disorder and Conversion Disorder (which takes the form of PNES) in February of this year but I have been fighting with this disorder in one form or another since I was a child (there were a lot of misdiagnoses along the way). \n\nlet's go through your bullets one by one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. You don't have to be stressed at the moment of the seizure, in fact it could have been a small thing that happened in the grocery store last week and your brain has just taking this moment to react to it.                           \nAs for the orgasms, well your body is going through a LOT.  Heart racing, thoughts are scattered, blood is rushing and your breathing is heavy. as such your brain might be panicking and the only thing it knows how to protect itself it to have a seizure.  \n2. Shortness of breaths is something I had to fight through, I also stop breathing all together and honestly I've had to teach myself how to breath all over again. I would panic and hyperventilate and this is what it sounds like it happening to you.                                                         \nAnytime you're waiting in a line or watching TV or even on the toilet, breath in for counts of 10, hold for ten and breath out for ten (if this feels like too much, it was for me, start with a count of four and gradually move up from there).  while you are in a seizure since you are conscious, you can focus on the count (at least this is what helps me most of the time).\n3. When this started happening to me I was terrified. It once happened while I was alone in a classroom at collage and I could only move one hand on the computer. it took me I don't know how long to send the word help over msn messenger (yes, that shows my age) to my professor down the hall.                                              \nmy suggestion for this is to learn some sign language to help you communicate between you and others ""Yes"" ""no"" and the alphabet so you can spell things out. It will be hard but try to stay calm, you will be alright.          \nName five colours you see around you, five sounds, five smells, if you're still in it and you're not in a seizure yet, tell yourself a story or do a grocery list. anything that keeps your brain working and focused on anything other than the fact that you can't move. \n4. As for what to ask your Neurologist, tell him about when they happen including orgasms (if you can tell strangers on the internet you can tell the doctor), ask him about being observed. This is an extended stay in a special ward in a hospital for seizures but it's a surefire way to rule out epilepsy or anything that would cause the misfiring of the brain.  Also ask about Psychologists who are the ones that will be able to diagnose PNES. \n\nI hope these answer some of your questions and let you know you are not alone in this.",1572469140,t3_dpb8ob,/r/PNESsupport/comments/dpb8ob/is_this_pnes_super_confused_and_scared/f5u6ln2/

Your description is clear and concise and I'm sure it will be helpful for your neurologist--they live for good descriptions. They will likely recommend an ""ambulatory"" EEG (sending you home with a brainwave monitor for a day or two) or a stay in an ""epilepsy monitoring unit"" where you would have your brainwaves monitored while you are being filmed. It sounds weird, but it makes sense if you think about it. Brainwave changes with no changes in behavior? Neurologists are worried and have a bunch of questions. Brainwave changes with behavior changes? Neurologists know what to treat and (hopefully) how to treat it. Brainwaves stay the same but behavior changes?
