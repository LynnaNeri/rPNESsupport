They will also have people who are there involuntarily, usually by court order or a suicidal hold. </p>\n\n<p>If want you are currently doing is not helpful I recommend looking into CBT, DBT, EMDR, talk-therapy, psychiatrist, etc.</p>\n</div>", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/PNESsupport/comments/uhs4av/mental_ward/i781sod/", "subreddit_type": "restricted", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1651619842.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_uhs4av", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/PNESsupport", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 12, "_fetched": true}

I think I'll try EMDR, I've heard good things and haven't tried it yet. \n\nThe other thing bothering me about this Dx is that it seems the consensus is that PNES is harder to treat bc it's less understood, and as someone who is already a \"very complicated medical case\" and leaves doctors scratching their heads often, I just want an answer that doesn't feel like it's reaching for uber status on the scale of complication.\n\nI don't mean to sound morose or negative or even tone-deaf.

Believe me when I say you are NOT alone on this. I'm pretty sure everyone with a seizure disorder and honestly, many disabilities, goes through this at some point in their lives. Your disability may dictate your limitations and it's so hard to navigate this world with disabilities, so all of your emotions, whether you feel hopeless, lost, or anything, is all based on things that are very real. Getting care alone is hard, much less living with things that are unclear on a day to day basis is exhausting. Be kind to yourself.

They allow for people to vent, looking for resources, and all sorts of other neat stuff. There's been several posts about folks with seizures and it's been very queer friendly, in my experience. (I'm a bisexual, gender non conforming person, if that helps for perspective.) You might be able to snag some ideas on helping navigate your day to day life in other ways that we might not think of here.  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \nRegardless if you're diagnosed or not, if you suspect you have PNES, I recommend try reading  \"Taking Control of Your Seizures\" by Joel M Reiter, Donna Andrews, Charlotte Reiter, and W. Curt LaFrance Jr. This was recommended to me by my neurologist and the psychiatrist that helped with my PNES diagnosis. It's a workbook on helping with treatment around your seizures and it's highly recommended for medical professionals who may have to treat patients who have non-epileptic seizures. 10/10 I recommend.  \n\n\n  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \nSupport systems vary for so many different factors including healthcare access and relationship status with people around them, including but not limited to romantic relationships. I'm really sorry you and your partner had to split. Having to go through that is already tough and it sounds like you cared a lot about each other based on how you talked about them. I hope you and your partner can come to a point where things are better for the both of you.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \n\n\nIn terms of ticks, I do have one but it's not during my seizures and it's directly tied to my stress and anxiety levels. Being on more appropriate medications now that I've gotten my Bipolar Type 1 diagnosis has pretty much eliminated that tick. (It was a weird head snapping/jerking motion with a weird shiver that was insanely uncomfortable.)  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nI might be able to get to a point to where I can live alone, but as it stands, I can't. My Bipolar disorder is far from stable, which directly affects my seizures, as we've recently discovered. After manic episodes, I drop *hard*, which also includes me seizing. The body pains and aches from the seizures, my inability to think clearly, to bathe myself, all of that, tends to go out the window. TL;DR - Much of my independence has been stripped from me. However, I'm in a very privileged situation where I have a very caring and trusting partner who, despite his mental struggles, is stable enough to help care for me. When I'm relatively stable, like today, I can handle most things myself, though.  \n\n\n  \n\n\nNot everyone with a seizure disorder has a situation like mine. Some are worse, some are better. It's also really common for people with PNES to suddenly seem like they've been \"cured\" or simply stop having seizures, because sometimes getting that diagnosis helps ease the mind, reducing the anxiety that not having a diagnosis can bring. So, getting a diagnosis might very well be a solution. Much of what you're afraid of now could easily go away once you get your diagnosis, depending on how you and your brain responds to it. Even if you continue to have seizures, you'll have a better idea of what is likely a trigger for you, but you can pinpoint that without a diagnosis, thankfully.  \n\n\n  \n\n\nI do very much feel as though I'm a burden on my partner very often. What helps alleviate that is a combination of maintaining my treatment to minimize seizures, being able to adapt with my partner to changes, and communication. Learning to talk to your partner, platonic or romantic, about the experiences around your fears, as well as giving them space to talk to you about their experience being a caretaker is one of the most important things about that type of dynamic. There are many times where their feelings have to come last, but giving them the appropriate space and tools to help cope is important. It's also about learning how to communicate. My partner never told me I was a burden, but there were other things he has said when I first started having seizures. (We had been together nearly 2 years by that point.) Later, he realized his frustrations weren't with me; it was him being upset with the fact that I had so limited resources and had been basically abandoned by my family. He and I learning what his emotions were, where they stemmed from and how to say it was such a make or break thing for us. It cut our arguments in half. It's made us more affectionate, and it's made understanding our collective disabilities so much more. I still struggle with it very often, but I don't struggle nearly as much with it now that my partner and I have a better understanding of my limitations, his limitations and what our resources are.   \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \nSadly, I don't know anyone who has both PNES and Tourettes, but I'm sure there are people out there with it. I'd try looking around the Tourettes community specifically. That community has some really kind people on TikTok, so I imagine they have a solid community here. Again, might be worth checking out in that Facebook group I mentioned. I'm not educated enough on that disorder in order to say how it may be affecting your potential seizures.  \n\n\n  \n\n\nAs for your HRT, being on T itself isn't necessarily something I've ever heard of triggering a seizure for people with PNES, in and of itself. (I'm NOT a doctor, so I cannot confirm or deny this.) However, if your hormone levels aren't where they should be, as directed by your healthcare providers, the side effects could trigger it, specifically if it's related to stress, sleep deprivation, and other side effects like that. As someone with two hormonal disorders, I can tell you first hand that if you're still experiencing menstrual cycles, TRACK IT. Depending on your menstrual side effects, those side effects could be a trigger. I know some of mine, like headaches and sleep disruption, is one for me. It's why treating my PCOS and Hypothyroidism is so important to me.  \n\n\n  \n\n\nThere's also the fun part of HRT, much like my estrogen treatment, where when they either increase or decrease your dosage. Yeah, that part is fun because it's like a mini puberty, as I like to call it. The changes from that can be something that is a trigger, much like menstrual cycles.  \n\n\n  \n\n\nLearning your triggers is one of the biggest things to not only getting a diagnosis, but also regaining independence. There, of course, is limitations, but once you can pinpoint what those triggers are, you can learn to manage around it while learning to find solutions for those triggers.   \n\n\n  \n\n\nStart logging everything. Your daily moods, diet, medications, socializing habits, exercises, anything. You can be as detailed as you want, but log it all. The other thing that I highly recommend is having anyone you trust to make sure they know in advance to record these events and time them. You want these to show to your doctors because that can be make or break in how soon you get a diagnosis. It GREATLY helped mine, that's for sure.  \n\n\n  \n\n\nSorry for the basically book long details but I hope this helps. <3 Best of luck to you.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_i5f2ik0", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>This is gunna be a bit long but hopefully, this is helpful. &lt;3  </p>\n\n<p>For perspective, I&#39;m diagnosed with PNES, PTSD, Bipolar Type 1, PCOS and Hypothyroidism.

I'm 25y/o male. I have been diagnosed with Anxiety (I can never recall which type), Bipolar, Borderline Personality Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, OCD, ADD, and conversion Disorder, to name a few.. I've been to the hospital for my episodes more times than I can count. I've seen more specialist than I can count. One of the appointments I waited about 5-6months for at OHSU. It was about an hour-long drive, then another hour for the doctor, then an hour-long explanation of what I've already been told before that can be summed up with, all of what I would've done has already been done, there isn't much more I can do. I say this not to discourage but to show I know how frustrating it can be.\n\n One of the main factors that really convinces me that it was Conversion Disorder and P.N.E.S. that I was dealing with was it comin' on when work was gettin' devastatingly stressful and becoming increasingly so and had so sign of stopping. I was workin' at an assisted livin' during the time of these symptoms coming up. I loved workin' with the residents but the stress of management was overwhelming; they were shady and irresponsible and put the health and safety of the Elderly at risk all the time. They also had me workin' while my hands burned and bled while workin'.\n\n   The first time I had an episode, it was as if my legs just suddenly stopped workin'. I was home pettin' my roommates cat on the edge of my bed when I suddenly got really dizzy and went down to the floor. Fortunately, I was on my knees at the time. Unfortunately my phone was on the table in the dining room so I had to make my way over there partially an army and partially like a lea lion. Despite bein' really confused of why this would be happenin', I still stayed positive and do what I normally do and kind of commentated myself out loud as if I was in a satire film of some sort because stress wasn't goin' to help anythin' and just be thankful that I've got an amazing friend that lived in the same apartment complex that knew a thing or two about the anatomy and would be right over once I gave them a call. \n\n  Besides stress, another correlation, I have a found was that many of times it happens in the evening when I am home and tryin' to relax. Because of them typically occuring in the evening, I feel as though the stress throughout the day is kinda bottled up and then thrown at myself as a molotov cocktail.  I hope that makes.\n\n As far as techniques go, I try to keep track when it happens and the possible why. When I feel like I *might* have one comin' on, I will use the restroom, and get myself a cup of water and lay down, or least find a comfortable spot that I will stay seated at until the feeling goes away because I know that the last thing I need is to fall and hit my head yet again. If I feel like it could be awhile before I am confident enough to get up without potentially falin' and that I'm  beginnin' feelin' hungry, I have to remind myself to just grab a nature valley bar (or somethin' of the sort) instead because makin' myself a full meal is not worth the risk of fallin' and hurtin' my head.\n\n When I got to the point that I decided I was goin' to put my two weeks in whether or not I had another job lined up because I had had enough (honestly should've been when I had an episode at work that ended with me bein' takin' away in an ambulance). Fortunately, I got hired at a place that I couldn't believe was goin' to be my escape and got to start right when I left my previous job. This is one of the suggestions that is in that book that involved using what control you have over the environment around you so it is less stressful. This worked wonders for the longest time. My episodes went *way* **down** other than fatigue and vertigo but bein' paralyzed and unable to move felt like it could actually be a thing of the pass. \n\n  That was until my Grandmother passed away and I had one at the memorial service while I was sittin' on the pew. For the longest time, no one noticed because during this time, I was front row lookin' forward, frozen, like a stature, unable to not much more than my eyes.  When they did notice me, my mom felt bad but when she asked me if I wanted to layed down so I could rest, I used quite a bit of energy to nod my head ever so softly. When I was out, I had an experience that the best way I can describe was that I paid a visit to my Grandma in my head as if I traveled back in time (since she hadn't been livin' in her house in years) though I was the same age. During this time, it was as if there was an intercom of what I was hearin' in the real world. It was quite the experience. I eventually came to in the hospital, and when I eventually got home, I slept for 13 hours.\n\n   I apologize for havin' such a long response, I didn't think I would end up typin' near this much but regardless, I hope this helps. \n\n The most basic suggestions would be\n\n* Stay hydrated\n* Try [breathing techniques](https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/breathing-to-reduce-stress)\n* Try out the app \"**Bearable**\" to keep track of stress, meds, energy, and other variables\n* Keep calm (I know the struggle) \"Your mind is like this water, my friend.

When I started my third round of treatments, my doctor put me back on the lowest dose of Prozac twice daily. He said I can take .5mg of lorazepam up to 3 times daily if needed for anxiety. I only take it once a day now. I started DBT therapy to help me be mindful of my emotions and pay more attention on how it makes me body react. I also found that discussing undisclosed trauma I had experienced in my teen years (seizures started around that time) with my spouse and therapist helped me get some closure and seizures have gone from happening nearly every day to none at all. I am over half way through my third round of TMS treatments now and have been doing fantastic. I am more active and productive around the house, my energy levels have increased, and I\u2019m feeling much happier.

Please ask your psychiatrist about TMS and look into DBT therapy if you haven\u2019t already! </p>\n\n<p>Change in overall severity:\nHighly severe (5) \u2192 Negligible (1)</p>\n\n<p>My current quality of life:\nExcellent</p>\n\n<p>Time on this treatment:\nApproximately 2 years</p>\n\n<p>Side effects I experienced:\nHeadache, jaw discomfort</p>\n\n<p>MORE ABOUT MY CONDITION\nMy Symptoms (all, including before an effective treatment):\nConvulsions, depression, anxiety</p>\n\n<p>First symptom noticed:\nHigh levels of stress</p>\n\n<p>Treatments I\u2019ve tried to date:\nPrior to TMS I was on 5 different medications including mood stabilizer lamictal, Prozac for depression, buspar and Xanax for anxiety. TMS treatments helped me get off all of my anti depressants but then the episodes increased. When I started my third round of treatments, my doctor put me back on the lowest dose of Prozac twice daily. He said I can take .5mg of lorazepam up to 3 times daily if needed for anxiety. I only take it once a day now. I started DBT therapy to help me be mindful of my emotions and pay more attention on how it makes me body react. I also found that discussing undisclosed trauma I had experienced in my teen years (seizures started around that time) with my spouse and therapist helped me get some closure and seizures have gone from happening nearly every day to none at all. I am over half way through my third round of TMS treatments now and have been doing fantastic. I am more active and productive around the house, my energy levels have increased, and I\u2019m feeling much happier. These seizures are caused by stress and now that I have that in check I think it\u2019s smooth sailing from here. If you haven\u2019t looked into TMS and meds haven\u2019t helped, I would!</p>\n\n<p>My tips:\nMeditation, mindfulness, DBT, and TMS can be the answer to treating this condition.\nWhat aggravates my condition:\nStress</p>\n\n<p>More about me:\nMy ethnicity is Puerto Rican, I&#39;m rarely stressed, I&#39;m average wei</p>\n</div>", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/PNESsupport/comments/sc4wnx/pnes_anyones_seizures_similar/hueukm7/", "subreddit_type": "restricted", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1643268613.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_sc4wnx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/PNESsupport", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2, "_fetched": true}

Here's my medical conditions that effect my seizures in one way or another: Hypothyroidism, PCOS, Bipolar Disorder, PTSD, anxiety disorder.  \n\n\nLet me also preface this with that, as confirmed by a psychiatrist who specializes in PNES and other similar disorders, most folks, once they get their diagnosis, see a significant drop in seizures, and sometimes intensity of the seizure. Part of it is because of the mental struggle of everything involving being medically validating, but it also usually comes with the conclusion as to \\*what\\* is triggering them. While not exactly \"curable\", it is very much a treatable disorder.   \n\n\n  \nYou mentioned grand mal seizure. Is he diagnosed with a neurological seizure disorder or is that merely a description for it? I ask just for clarification. Either way, yes, stress and anxiety can trigger PNES, but it can also be a trigger for a neurological seizure. Only a neurologist will be able to rule out of it's a neurological disorder or not. I went through EKGs, short term and long term EEGS (my longest was at the hospital for roughly 72 hours), CT scans and some other stuff. For my 72 hour EEG, the goal was to trigger a seizure intentionally to see what type it was, so they took me off my AEDs, which are also mood balancers, forced me into sleep deprivation, used lighting patterns, and tried to basically stress me out in as many ways as they humanely could within reasonable means. Part of my care team included a psychiatrist who specializes in dealing with PNES and other similar conditions. He and my neurologist were the ones that diagnosed me, not my usual psychiatrist.  \n\n\n  \nIn terms of finding a psychiatrist, absolutely find a psychiatrist who, at MINIMUM, is willing to learn about PNES. My neurologist and hospital psychiatrist recommended my usual psychiatric care team to read \"Taking Control of Your Seizures\" by Joel M Reither, Donna Andrews, Charlotte Reither, and W. Curt LaFrane Jr. I HIGHLY recommend it for you to read as well.  \n\n\n  \nAs recommended above, a seizure journal, but honestly, a journal overall.  \nHere's what helped me rule out a lot of things early on with the doctor.  \n1) We made sure my thyroid was balanced and my reproductive parts were \"healthy\" or functioning as they should be. I continued to have seizures despite this, but it did reduce some of my seizures once my thyroid was balanced out. I had to track my menstrual cycles with this, but assuming I'm assuming your son isn't trans. In the event they are, still continue to track this.  \n\n\n2) Tracked my diet in my journal, less concerned with a \"healthy\" diet and more so just sharing with my doctors what I was eating to find potential trigger foods. I was very specific on my caffeine intake more than anything.  \n\n\n3) Tracked my daily moods. Didn't necessarily go into detail. Always tried to keep it in simple terms, like depressed, happy, etc. Included if I had suicidal thoughts, extreme feelings of joy and happiness, energy drops/increases, etc.  \n\n\n4) Tracked daily activities, such as gym routines, social outings, etc.  \n\n\n5) Track BP and, if possible, maybe even sugar levels. If it seems to be normal for the most part, only track these things around the seizures themselves.  \n\n\n6) Write down anything and everything pertaining to the seizure itself; did he potty on himself? (I know that sounds silly, but it's relevant.) did he have a headache? What did that headache feel like? How did his body feel? What were the body aches like? Where exactly were the body aches; were they all over or only in certain general regions? was he dizzy, nauseous, able to hear, speak, and understand when he was spoken to? What all could he hear? Did he remember anything leading up to the seizure? What was his overall vision like before and after? Did he smell anything in particular, like phantom smells? Can he swallow water on his own? Any numbness? Can he follow and understand basic commands, such as holding up his hand when you lift  it? Was he disoriented/able to tell you basic info, like his name or the date?  \n\n\n  \n\n\nSomething else I HIGHLY recommend you do, especially for the neurologist, is to RECORD the seizure. Witnessing one can be very traumatic. It may seem very cold hearted to sit by and record a seizure, as if he were some form of spectacle, but I promise, if you can get anyone watching to record it and show the doctor, it'll greatly help, not only in finding a diagnosis, but it's helpful when a doctor begins to doubt his condition, because I promise, SOMEONE will at some point. On top of recording it, check his BP whether you do it manually or use an at home mechanism.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese were some of the things that not only helped me with my PNES diagnosis, but it helped with my recent diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder. Knowing he's dealing with such extreme anxiety, he may just have an anxiety disorder, OR it could be another underlying mental illness. Keep in mind, mental illnesses like Bipolar Disorder isn't a form of moral failing. Many of them are strictly chemical imbalances, just like with Hypothyroidism or Diabetes, but specific to certain parts of the brain is all. These CAN be triggered by social/real life issues, head trauma, other medical trauma, or even genetics. Even ones that are a result of emotional/mental trauma, it's still not a moral failing on his or your part. (Unless you were the abuser, but based on your concern, I'm heavily inclined to not think you are.) For some people, like myself, getting appropriate medication and coping mechanisms for my disorder has significantly reduced not only the number of seizures I have, but their intensity.  \n\n\n  \n\n\n I know this was long, but it's everything I could think of off the  top of my head.

It\u2019s definitely something you should discuss with a doctor- I personally speak to my psychiatrist, therapist and my pcp. It can feel very confusing especially when you don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening. Even now for me someone who has had sporadic  episodes since 2015 it\u2019s a hard distinction at times knowing which is about to happen/ has happened. From my experience there are a couple of signs- I\u2019ll randomly notice a part of my body that has that numb/ tingly sensation(sometimes hours before it even happens, I write it down just incase that random sensation is in fact relevant). normally I think I\u2019m about to have a panic attack prior to the seizure but there\u2019s something extremely worse about the feeling- I have a few seconds before I lose control over my body (I have just enough time to realize somethings wrong and lay down or to myself identify like I have that pre panic attack feeling). It\u2019s almost the same off sensation where everything feels out of place and that initial panic sets in ( for me I get sweaty/ hot things just feel wrong and then I become almost hyper aware of my heartbeat breathing the way things feel) . Only difference with a panic attack is I\u2019m aware throughout its entirety I feel everything that is happening in that moment. When it comes to the seizure i have that panic attack feeling and I blank.I wake up with memory gaps, a raging headache feeling very panicked, my body feels sore, and I find myself feeling so cold with shivers. But I have no recollection until I start piecing together little bits of information. Even then I notice for a day or two my mind feels very scattered and confused.

It\u2019s definitely something you should discuss with a doctor- I personally speak to my psychiatrist, therapist and my pcp. It can feel very confusing especially when you don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening. Even now for me someone who has had sporadic  episodes since 2015 it\u2019s a hard distinction at times knowing which is about to happen/ has happened. From my experience there are a couple of signs- I\u2019ll randomly notice a part of my body that has that numb/ tingly sensation(sometimes hours before it even happens, I write it down just incase that random sensation is in fact relevant). normally I think I\u2019m about to have a panic attack prior to the seizure but there\u2019s something extremely worse about the feeling- I have a few seconds before I lose control over my body (I have just enough time to realize somethings wrong and lay down or to myself identify like I have that pre panic attack feeling). It\u2019s almost the same off sensation where everything feels out of place and that initial panic sets in ( for me I get sweaty/ hot things just feel wrong and then I become almost hyper aware of my heartbeat breathing the way things feel) . Only difference with a panic attack is I\u2019m aware throughout its entirety I feel everything that is happening in that moment. When it comes to the seizure i have that panic attack feeling and I blank.I wake up with memory gaps, a raging headache feeling very panicked, my body feels sore, and I find myself feeling so cold with shivers. But I have no recollection until I start piecing together little bits of information. Even then I notice for a day or two my mind feels very scattered and confused. Since I used to have a lot of panic attacks it became habitual the moment I noticed the change in perception of my environment I\u2019d record.

PNES does not mean by any means that you are permanently disabled or can't feel 'normal' or do 'normal things' other people do.  I think the word 'disabled' is always misinterpreted to mean damaged or broken and that you can never have things that normal abled people have.

For example, my sleep disorder can work in tandem with my PNES to trigger seizures so I work jobs that allow me to set my hours to accommodate for my sleep issues.  I learned that heat exhaustion can trigger my seizures so when I'm doing intense sports or exercise, I make sure to have a few cold packs on hand and a good insulated bottle of very cold water.  High sugar or caffeine can trigger twitching, so I always make sure to order without at restaurants.  Having a dog or cat to pet significantly helps my twitching and seizures.  These are all really small things that make a big difference to me and no one would ever know unless I told them. \n\nSo it's good to keep in mind that many people have chronic illnesses, physical and mental, and many triggers, and you pass by them everyday on the street without ever realizing.

I had these the most averaging around 4 hours almost daily seizures when I first developed PNES.  For me, my body will always get to a point where the 'energy' finally gets all out and I'm extremely exhausted and pass out/have a couple hour nap.  I tried multiple drugs by my psych to prevent and stop an ongoing seizure but nothing worked for me, I don't believe I was ever given xanax to try but I was given several anti-anxiety medications for it.  I completely understand and encourage you to get off it and find an alternative, no matter how hard it is or how much work it takes in the beginning. \n\nLook into treatments like CBT and EFT and continue seeing a therapist if you are, if you aren't, I highly recommend those three treatment options first. Telehealth is very accessible now so you don't have to worry about leaving home for these.  I don't know if you live with someone, but once I had a seizure and my partner began slowly dragging his hands from the base of my skull down my spine with a little pressure almost like a massage.  Doing this a few times had a significant effect for me and it felt like my nerves were being 'reset' or switched back into place and my seizure calmed down very quickly.  That's still the most effective thing I've ever experienced for stopping a seizure.\n\nOther things I've done during seizures because no drugs worked for me, were finding something very simple to train my focus on to bring me out of my dissociation and calm down my muscles.  Disney or Ghibli movies ended up being a very good one for me, just make sure it has no disturbing or too dark of themes (or sound or light stimulus) because your brain is extremely vulnerable in that state.  Also if you have animals, cats and dogs just being near or petting or cuddling if you have the motor control are significantly helpful, especially in lowering heart rate.  If you don't have animals, I highly suggest getting a cat.  \n\nTo prevent seizures, I like to keep something regular with exercise or blood circulation, even if its just walking or stretching.  Healthy diet and nothing like artificial sugars, chemicals or caffeine (and be careful with vitamin B!) are a huge help to me.  Someone mentioned earlier that low blood sugar can also cause them which is absolutely true.  A good sleep and hygiene routine is a big help, even if you can just do little tasks around the home, reward and praise yourself and really prioritize self care and things that make you feel comfy.

The body (and this goes for animals too) is designed to physically shake like this when experiencing trauma to release it, so imo for most people, their seizures are due to stress and trauma, whether its ongoing, leftover or both.  You are being pushed too much and this is the body's way of release because you aren't consciously able to.  It's akin to how we throw up when we ingest something poisonous. \n\nI hope some of that was able to help!

This is just my view on it, of course, from my limited experience in the mental health field as merely a patient with now doctorate. - G/K</p>\n</div>", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "subreddit_type": "restricted", "can_gild": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/PNESsupport/comments/phb6wq/why_do_doctors_only_suggest_cbt/hc9zun5/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "name": "t1_hc9zun5", "created": 1631250737.0, "subreddit": "<not serializable>", "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1631250737.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/PNESsupport", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 4, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "mod_note": null, "distinguished": null, "_fetched": true}

That\u2019s my job.. </p>\n\n<p>I worry about CPS taking her because I sometimes can\u2019t do enough, and her dad works a lot.. I worry that maybe I shouldn\u2019t be her mom.. that I can\u2019t do enough for her..</p>\n\n<p>I spend hours a week trying to reframe my view of it, or find some new scientific breakthrough, like how we all have a low NPY count and the vegan diet can help elevate that.. but no one else wants to make the jump and it\u2019s dangerous for me to cook sometimes.. </p>\n\n<p>I\u2019ve tried to get someone to take me to the government offices to get assistance and insurance since their system doesn\u2019t think I exist for almost a year. It\u2019s 3 hours away if I walk, and we don\u2019t have buses or cabs. 37 minutes if I was an experienced biker who actually owned a bike, but I never took to it as a kid. I need to see a dentist, even sensidine (spelling??) hurts now.</p>\n\n<p>I don\u2019t have my own money so I have to ask for everything. So I can\u2019t even get a bike to learn how to do it to travel places.. </p>\n\n<p>I want to get away from the in-laws but we can\u2019t afford anywhere to live so we\u2019re staying with them, and my skills and capabilities don\u2019t apply to 98% of at home jobs, the other 2% I can\u2019t do while taking care of a toddler who we also can\u2019t afford to put in daycare. </p>\n\n<p>Ughh sometimes I just want my existence to fade away already\u2026 then I remember my kid.. and then I don\u2019t know what to feel..</p>\n</div>", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/PNESsupport/comments/pcd6sl/how_has_pnes_effected_you/hakxyg7/", "subreddit_type": "restricted", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1630085400.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_pcd6sl", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/PNESsupport", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2, "_fetched": true}
