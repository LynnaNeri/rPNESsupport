During the tonic phase, a person typically stiffens and falls to the ground unconscious. The clonic phase begins with strong, rhythmic shaking movements.

Their eyes may roll back, they may stare, or their eyelids may flutter. Absence seizures typically start suddenly, last a few seconds, and then stop suddenly.\n\nSIMPLE PARTIAL SEIZURES\u00a0These seizures involve only one part of the brain. Symptoms will vary depending on which part of the brain is involved. Unlike tonic-clonic and absence seizures, people experiencing simple partial seizures remain fully conscious. Common symptoms include stiffness or shaking in one part of the body or an abnormal feeling such as numbness or an unpleasant smell or taste.

Then I started to have another kind of seizure where I was more &quot;aware&quot;, I just could not interact or control my movements/emotions, etc. They ALL last under a minute. </p>\n\n<p>The 2nd kind of seizure is more &quot;triggered&quot; than when I had the generalized ones. I had auras with the other kind too, which I do not have with the &quot;aware&quot; kind of seizures. </p>\n\n<p>With the seizures I have now, I feel something coming...like a feeling in the gut that rises up and then my body pulls back and to the left. My left arm curls and the left hand makes a claw or fist. My left eye bulges out and then rolls up and to the left. I drool, cry, shake and grunt. </p>\n\n<p>They last about a minute.</p>\n</div>", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/PNESsupport/comments/mfquca/brief_seizures/gsp0lpv/", "subreddit_type": "restricted", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1617030584.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_mfquca", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/PNESsupport", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3, "_fetched": true}

I didn\u2019t know what step I was on in the cooking process, but reasoned out that I had turned the meat in the pan and added spices.

He thought I may have BOTH PNES and epilepsy.\n\nPNES is not that common, from what I hear and the best diagnostic tool, so I have read, is a video EEG.\n\nI stopped going to the neurologists in 2016. One thing I did find out is that my seizures go away when I take STRONG medications to stop them......it is compliance that is an issue, (I have bipolar I and when manic, have problems being consistent taking the meds....even the psychiatric ones)\n\nAs for your situation, I would start with a neurologist. Have a loved one or friend take a video when you have your next seizure. THIS would be immensely helpful to any neurologist you see.

Only ONE out of the 7 neurologists I have seen since 2009 has suggested PNES (and only because of my history of PTSD, trauma and anxiety). I also have had 5 concussions and a mystery virus that caused me to have a 104 fever in college. He thought I may have BOTH PNES and epilepsy.</p>\n\n<p>PNES is not that common, from what I hear and the best diagnostic tool, so I have read, is a video EEG.</p>\n\n<p>I stopped going to the neurologists in 2016. One thing I did find out is that my seizures go away when I take STRONG medications to stop them......it is compliance that is an issue, (I have bipolar I and when manic, have problems being consistent taking the meds....even the psychiatric ones)</p>\n\n<p>As for your situation, I would start with a neurologist. Have a loved one or friend take a video when you have your next seizure. THIS would be immensely helpful to any neurologist you see. Since most of my seizures happened at night, my husband has never been able to catch one on video. I have only had maybe 10 seizures in public and during the day.</p>\n</div>", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/PNESsupport/comments/liyrcw/a_breakdown_of_my_symptoms_and_medical_history/gn78did/", "subreddit_type": "restricted", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1613219378.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_liyrcw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/PNESsupport", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3, "_fetched": true}

Epilepsy is a life-threatening condition. And the treatments for it, in my opinion, are brutal. It is a relief that I am not having epileptic seizures. However, I am still having these events. So if they are not epilepsy, they are still happening and affecting me and my life. So they still need treatment and we need to take action. Whatever the cause is. </p>\n\n<p>Finally, as I read another redditor post below, I have received injuries while seizing. Either from falling into it or from the movements during it.

Lots to address here.  Prepare for wall of text.  In June 2015, I started having episodes, which docs assumed was epilepsy.  I was put on Keppra, which didn\u2019t help; event frequency increased.  After months of doctors (neurologist, epileptologist, and psychologist), medical tests, increased Keppra, and the implosion of my life, I was finally diagosed with PNES.  One contributing cause was sleep disorders which caused decades of sleep deprivation (insomnia, dreaming in non-rem stages, lack of circadian rhythm).  Another cause was sleep apnea.  Another was chronic pain from joint problems and myelin deficiency (which causes misfiring nerves, sending pain/burning impulses to my brain every few minutes).  Stress put me over the edge, but the biggest cause was Complex PTSD.  Let\u2019s just say I had an interesting childhood.  \n\nI was taken off Keppra.  I was put on Amitriptyline nightly, which helps me fall sleep and stay asleep (no more waking 8 times each night, struggling to fall asleep again).  It also helps a bit with pain and anxiety, too.  Being able to sleep every night was amazing!  Then I got my cpap machine, and my dreaming calmed down (still vivid and too often, but better).  I am better oxygenated, too.   My memory has improved, and my thinking is so much clearer (before treatment, I really thought I had dementia), and I started going a couple months between PNES events\n\nTreating the C-PTSD is a much slower and harder process.  In August of 2019, I started EMDR therapy.  This has made the biggest difference to me personally, but I would not have been capable of doing it had I not treated the other conditions first.  I am told that my PNES events will likely stop when I\u2019ve finished EMDR therapy.  I hope so.\n\nSo, you\u2019ve already addressed his sleep disorders.  Good.  Keep on top of that.  I have been told by a neurologist, my GP, and my therapist to sleep as much as possible.  Naps ae your friend.  Anxiety & stress are definitely event triggers.

Lots to address here.  Prepare for wall of text.  In June 2015, I started having episodes, which docs assumed was epilepsy.  I was put on Keppra, which didn\u2019t help; event frequency increased.  After months of doctors (neurologist, epileptologist, and psychologist), medical tests, increased Keppra, and the implosion of my life, I was finally diagosed with PNES.  One contributing cause was sleep disorders which caused decades of sleep deprivation (insomnia, dreaming in non-rem stages, lack of circadian rhythm).  Another cause was sleep apnea.  Another was chronic pain from joint problems and myelin deficiency (which causes misfiring nerves, sending pain/burning impulses to my brain every few minutes).  Stress put me over the edge, but the biggest cause was Complex PTSD.  Let\u2019s just say I had an interesting childhood.  </p>\n\n<p>I was taken off Keppra.  I was put on Amitriptyline nightly, which helps me fall sleep and stay asleep (no more waking 8 times each night, struggling to fall asleep again).  It also helps a bit with pain and anxiety, too.  Being able to sleep every night was amazing!  Then I got my cpap machine, and my dreaming calmed down (still vivid and too often, but better).  I am better oxygenated, too.   My memory has improved, and my thinking is so much clearer (before treatment, I really thought I had dementia), and I started going a couple months between PNES events</p>\n\n<p>Treating the C-PTSD is a much slower and harder process.  In August of 2019, I started EMDR therapy.  This has made the biggest difference to me personally, but I would not have been capable of doing it had I not treated the other conditions first.  I am told that my PNES events will likely stop when I\u2019ve finished EMDR therapy.  I hope so.</p>\n\n<p>So, you\u2019ve already addressed his sleep disorders.  Good.  Keep on top of that.  I have been told by a neurologist, my GP, and my therapist to sleep as much as possible.  Naps ae your friend.  Anxiety &amp; stress are definitely event triggers.  Your dad may need an anti-anxiety med.  Yoga also helps.  Seriously, it\u2019s surprising how much.    Also, if he has chronic pain, he needs help for that.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, PNES is very often caused by PTSD and sexual abuse.  Do you know if he has that history?

Now the last one I had was over two months ago, I\u2019m about to graduate with my masters this weekend, and am currently looking for a part-time job to start with. So there are ways to manage it and it definitely doesn\u2019t have to mean your life is over, but it\u2019s a lot of hard work. I will say that it very much changed the trajectory of my life, but I\u2019ve come to accept that and am starting to look forward to a different kind of future. Everyone is different with the way PNES affects them, but there is definitely hope!</p>\n</div>", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_k91q5p", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/PNESsupport/comments/k91q5p/deleted_by_user/gf2trcp/", "subreddit_type": "restricted", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1607452081.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1607452081.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/PNESsupport", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2, "_fetched": true}

I have been in a similar situation. Are you going to therapy? It\u2019s good you\u2019re recognizing your triggers and learning what they are. That\u2019s the first step! I don\u2019t really know what to tell you about everything or what is causing yours or advise you what to do, but I can explain my experience and what I\u2019ve found to be the source of the seizures I\u2019ve had. \n\nI had an abusive and neglectful family growing up. My siblings and I were shut down whenever we tried to share emotions. There were things that I thought were normal that I now realize have done immeasurable harm to me. When I was 12 I was sexually assaulted for the first time and raped for the first time when I was 14. I had no parental supervision at all and raised myself. I continued holding all my feelings in and constantly felt worthless and unloved. I continued going through difficult situations because I was never taught how to handle them correctly and I didn\u2019t realize that I was surrounding myself with unhealthy people like my family. I\u2019ve suffered from CPTSD since my early teens. That comes along with anxiety and depression. I never realized that I was dissociating all those years to cope with my emotions and bad things that were happening. I never was taught healthy coping skills, just to bury everything. But eventually it became too much and I started having seizures and neurological deficits from all of the trauma. \n\nI\u2019m working on my masters in neurobiology and my understanding of it is that your fight-or-flight system (limbic system) gets switched to always being on. There is a third option in there, which is freeze. I freeze when I\u2019m threatened out of terror and then I dissociate from reality because it\u2019s too much. So this mechanism in my brain is faulty. The brain changes because of experiences. So when your limbic system is always in fight-or-flight mode, those connections get stronger and stronger and weird things start to happen, like dissociation and seizures. There is a way to rewire your brain. I meditate nearly every day because meditation strengthens your orbital medial prefrontal cortex (OMPFC). This part of your brain modulates your limbic system and it\u2019s the part that makes rational decisions. So when your limbic system turns on, your OMPFC turns off. So ideally, if you can strengthen the part of your brain that counteracts your wonky limbic system then it will stop going crazy all the time. Plus meditation is good for relaxation. \n\nAlong with that, I needed to go to serious therapy to deal with all the trauma I\u2019ve been through and learn healthy coping and communication skills. Overall I\u2019ve stopped having seizures, though I\u2019ve found that my family is my main trigger so I\u2019ve stopped talking to them mostly. Stress triggers them too, but if it\u2019s neutral I\u2019m much more able to find solutions and handle it. I\u2019m not able to work currently because I get overwhelmed and exhausted easily. I\u2019m still going to school part time and living off school loans while I get everything under control. I worry about doing that but the research regarding NES has shown that once people go on disability they are much less likely to stop having seizures because they essentially give up. This is obviously not true for everyone though and sometimes you have no other choice. I was lucky and in my area there is a research treatment program for people with NES to understand what it is and learn coping skills. I\u2019d definitely recommend looking around for something like that in your area, though it may not exist. But from the other people that were in the treatment program with me, I definitely found that therapy is a must. I\u2019ve also been looking into getting an emotional support dog. I\u2019ve found that dogs help keep me calm and I\u2019m able to do so many more normal things. My hope is that by the time I graduate this summer I\u2019ll be at a place where I can work and be a contributing member of society. \n\nI don\u2019t know if any of this helps you at all, it\u2019s just what helped me. Everyone is different. But I do wish you so much luck. Be kind to yourself. It\u2019s what I struggle with the most. We all deserve kindness and love. I know it\u2019s awful and scary right now and everything to get through this is difficult. But it doesn\u2019t have to mean the end of everything.

Mine came on after a head injury, and resemble temporal lobe seizures, which makes sense as that\u2019s where much of my brain injury is. I have been seeing a psychologist since the accident (part of a possible lawsuit) and he agrees that I have not suffered significant emotional trauma. Things have been hard, but I have excellent coping skills. \n\nThe idea that these episodes are only caused by emotional trauma is ludicrous, and a cop-out by neurologists who simply don\u2019t know yet what\u2019s going on. \n\nI plan on having my hormones tested too. I\u2019m peri-menopausal, and having had a partial hysterectomy years ago, I have no idea where I am in the process. So I don\u2019t know if my seizures are hormone-related. I do know my triggers are all physiological, not psychological. I can get deeply upset... no seizures. But if I have a smoothie for breakfast and rapidly raise my blood sugar? Seizures.

I thought no-one would respond with this thread, but glad I posted now. Others have asked me how I can carry such a burden. I have never felt this as a burden, I realised when you love someone and do something for them it never feels like work, and somehow automatically the energy to do tasks is there. I'm not saying it hasn't been frustrating, but I have learned a lot. Since my wife's last major suicide attempt (she jumped from a bridge near the house, miracle she survived, ICU for several days, had drowned and under for 10mins) we wondered about brain damage and initial prognosis was none. But even since she's had this paranoia. And in the beginning we'd have huge arguments about it while tried to convince her of the opposite. The most intense event her strong personality came out and tried to hurt her, one thing about her she will never hurt anyone else when she has a psychotic event and just tries to hurt herself and drawing blood gives her some relief from what she's told me. Quite often these events are intertwined with hallucinations that everything around her is breaking and falling apart.

I thought no-one would respond with this thread, but glad I posted now. Others have asked me how I can carry such a burden. I have never felt this as a burden, I realised when you love someone and do something for them it never feels like work, and somehow automatically the energy to do tasks is there. I&#39;m not saying it hasn&#39;t been frustrating, but I have learned a lot. Since my wife&#39;s last major suicide attempt (she jumped from a bridge near the house, miracle she survived, ICU for several days, had drowned and under for 10mins) we wondered about brain damage and initial prognosis was none. But even since she&#39;s had this paranoia. And in the beginning we&#39;d have huge arguments about it while tried to convince her of the opposite. The most intense event her strong personality came out and tried to hurt her, one thing about her she will never hurt anyone else when she has a psychotic event and just tries to hurt herself and drawing blood gives her some relief from what she&#39;s told me. Quite often these events are intertwined with hallucinations that everything around her is breaking and falling apart.

Heart racing, thoughts are scattered, blood is rushing and your breathing is heavy. as such your brain might be panicking and the only thing it knows how to protect itself it to have a seizure.  \n2. Shortness of breaths is something I had to fight through, I also stop breathing all together and honestly I've had to teach myself how to breath all over again.

When this started happening to me I was terrified. It once happened while I was alone in a classroom at collage and I could only move one hand on the computer. it took me I don't know how long to send the word help over msn messenger (yes, that shows my age) to my professor down the hall.                                              \nmy suggestion for this is to learn some sign language to help you communicate between you and others \"Yes\" \"no\" and the alphabet so you can spell things out.

As for what to ask your Neurologist, tell him about when they happen including orgasms (if you can tell strangers on the internet you can tell the doctor), ask him about being observed. This is an extended stay in a special ward in a hospital for seizures but it's a surefire way to rule out epilepsy or anything that would cause the misfiring of the brain.
