It\u2019s especially hard for older generations like our parents and grandparents to understand what is going on with our minds and bodies.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m sorry your therapist is away on holiday but if you need to talk to someone in the meantime you can take a look into possible walk in councillors who help are there just to listen to people who need a single session. There are 24/7 mental helplines available to just listen to you and talk to you. This is their job and they are trained specifically for it, this is a wonderful tool to have in your belt.</p>\n\n<p>If you ever need to talk (about anything, not just seizure disorders.) send me a message and I\u2019ll happily chat your ear off. </p>\n\n<p>PS.\nHere\u2019s a playlist of the first few vids I watched to help me understand the basics.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDHWj3vVQLri1u4RqSWattZf5bHvfJHMu\">PNES playlist</a></p>\n</div>", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/PNESsupport/comments/bxmpmu/struggling_with_my_new_pnes_diagnosis/erzp4mu/", "subreddit_type": "restricted", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1561444518.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_bxmpmu", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/PNESsupport", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2, "_fetched": true}
