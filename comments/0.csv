ipa4cgy,ukhby8,"Hey this is super late, so probably already resolved. I was there Oct-Nov 2021 if you refer to the young adult location in Monticello. (I was in the female one). It was helpful. I was basically their first ever patient after being opened, and so me and all the other girls I was with definitely struggled with staff not being sure what to do. It's probably different now since it's been about a year (crazy!). But aside from them being new and still figuring things out, it's probably the most helpful treatment I've done besides Pasadena PHP. That being said, my favorite staff were going to leave to work at the male facility so they might not be there anymore :(.

ja2w6wv,ukhby8,"Minnesota Monticello Newport \n\nI got there and they took away my phone (not my first rodeo, I knew this was going to happen) but then they told me that I wasn't allowed to make phone calls for the first 3days.  And that I'm not allowed to have visitors. \nIt seemed manageable at first. \nBut then my second day came. people are mean. And the staff are all the same age as you, but they act like they are so much better and smarter and they are so hurtful \n\nI stopped going to groups and I layed in bed because I was being harassed a lot by one of the girls. \nEvery half hour staff would come into my room and tell me insurance isn't going to pay for my stay if I just lay in bed, and how I'm not trying. And obviously it doesn't seem like I'm trying. But like c'mon. \n\nThey were extremely understaffed. There were only TWO staff for 6 people. \nAnd sometimes there'd only be one staff member in the whole house on weekends. And if that were the case, and someone couldn't go to the ""outings"" we all had to stay home. So we had our outside privileges revoked too. \n\nIt didn't get better. \nThe staff were just awful. Everyone's the same age as you. But they treat you like shit. \nThere was this one staff who would always harp on me. I would cry in bed because of how mean a couple of them were. I think she was a few years older then me. \n  \nMy therapist told me that my boyfriend was going to break up with me if I tried to leave early. And I tried asking for a new therapist but was literally laughed at like I was making a joke. \n\nThere was also no on site psych. All web based and there were only two\nThere were multiple times were my psych got me confused with someone else. And there was one time they accidentally gave me two meds that were not compatible and I had side effects. (Minor but still there) and I went to talk to the nurse practitioner and she was mad. (Oh yeah and the nurse practitioner was only licensed to practice on people 21 and younger. There was a different one who rarely came in though) \n\nAnd there was this one staff who would always say ""I'm not playing this game with you"" when I had ANXIETY ATTACKS.  \nAnd when I told her I wanted to leave she said I never tried to get better in the first place. (I've stuck it out for about two-three weeks at this point) \nThey constantly manipulated everything I said. They made it seem like I was the bad guy. Like I was in jail for doing something wrong. And whenever I would try to express that to people, they would literally tell me that I signed the papers. \nIts a big saying among the younger staff. (Like the ones our age)  they are constantly telling you ""well you DID sign up to be here"" \nLike you dont feel shit about it already. \n\nOh! And another thing that happens to most of the girls there, they randomly get kicked out because of insurance. Or the opposite. I've seen girls being forced to stay until their insurance says they won't pay anymore. \n\nYour whole stay is dependent on your insurance. They say that you have a plan and what not, but you don't really. So many people I've seen get kicked out because they're insurance didn't agree to pay the next week. (They do it weekly) \nAnd then what ends up happening, is that insurance won't pay for another stay anywhere else because you were just at Newport. \nThey sent a girl home (who lived across the country) in a grey hound. \nHer ride couldn't come soon enough so they sent her home on a bus. \nThey sent this mentally unstable, young female, home, alone, on a bus. ACROSS THE COUNTRY \nMost things they do are geared towards teens and kids. They very obviously just took their only adolescent program, and renamed it for adults. \nLike we had two hours a day for school. Two hours a day on a computer that most sites are blocked on. It's almost like a spit in the face. \nTLDR;\nThis place sucks.\nStaff are out numbered, mean, and inexperienced.\nYour literally in the middle of no where (the lake is inaccessible) \nInsurance will probably kick you out.\nYou will probably feel worse in the long run\nAnd I should probably sue or something. \nTerrible experience.",1677416941,t3_ukhby8,/r/PNESsupport/comments/ukhby8/newport_institute/ja2w6wv/

I just want to say that you escaped at the perfect time, the house literally went crazy right after you left… girls ran away, the food situation got way worse, instead of the one girl yelling we had three girls who were always pissed off at staff and yelling, we had a huge shortage in CCs and we had two psychiatrists who quit so we were left with one we called “Pot Patrol” who was basically convinced every one of us had a pot addiction and that’s why we were mentally ill, and we also had a girl make more than one suicide attempt while at the house. The CCs and counselor Taylor helped me so much and actually led to me readmitting after leaving ACA once. The upper level staff were so bad the second time around though… I still have nightmares about some of the stuff a few particular staff members said about me and it was so bad that my doctor aunt wanted to take legal action against them. If it weren’t for three people who were in the upper level staff, it would’ve been so much more helpful as the younger staff could’ve done more/what they wanted.

i781sod,uhs4av,"I was in a Psychiatric Ward for 4 months total (though split up.) And let me be very clear about this, you should ONLY voluntarily put yourself in a Psych-ward if you are actively 1. Wanting to kill yourself. 2. Wanting to hurt yourself. 3. Wanting to kill someone else. 4. Wanting to hurt someone else. Psychatric wards can be very truamatic even if you find a good one. You will encounter people there form all walks of life. And they will be there for one of the 4 reasons I just listed. And there is zero separation between the 4 different reasons. Everyone who ends up in the Psych-Ward is in the same area. A ward is a place for someone who is on the edge and really cannot be safe around themselves or others. It will make your PNES worse. If you are to consider any type of help like it I would recommend an out-patient facility where you go there everyday (varying hours depending on the place) and then you get to leave and go home once your day is over. In patient wards should be used as a last resort. And while outpatient wards are not as bad, they can still be truamatic. They will also have people who are there involuntarily, usually by court order or a suicidal hold. \n\nIf want you are currently doing is not helpful I recommend looking into CBT, DBT, EMDR, talk-therapy, psychiatrist, etc.",1651619842,t3_uhs4av,/r/PNESsupport/comments/uhs4av/mental_ward/i781sod/

i77zwbx,uhq50f,"Anyone claiming to be able to ""cure"" or ""fix"" any mental illness is a scam. No matter how long they do it for. Especially not C-PTSD or PNES. What I think this strange ""therapist"" is trying to do is figure out your ""unconscious"" mind. Which was a theory made in the Freudian area of Psychology. And is a very old way of thinking and very harmful. If she's talks a lot about dreams, and conscious vs. unconscious mind she is definitely one of these ""therapist"" And what your parents need to understand is that being labeled ""disabled"" only means that you need accomodations to be made for you to be able to do certain things. It's not an ""oh I'm disabled and now my life is going to be crap and I'll never be able to do anything."" It's simply a simple word to communicate that you need accomodations. And that is all. Progress is based on the individual and should never be based on any sort of metric. I have school accomodations right now and I HIGHLY recommend them to anyone who struggles with any type of disability. It's not like you have to go parading around to each teacher and list of your diagnosis to all of them. The person who does all the disability accomodations, will simply shit all of your professors an email of all the accomodations you have been approved for. And the professors by law have to abide by them. Do whatever you to drop that therapist as soon as possible. \n\nI would say the very real dangers of this type of ""therapy"" but I think someone else explains it better.

I'm also wondering if the possibity that you are having something which is triggering seizures or are having seizures which are triggering something else was discussed. I'm not trying to scare you, but I do know that other issues can mimic seizures.\n\nI'm a bit like you: seizures for over thirty years. Began having dailly seizures, which were presenting as focal seizures in November. Seizures slowed down from December-early March. Was mostly having cluster seizures lasting anywhere from ten minutes to six-seven hours. An MRI , CT, and EEG were done while I was having 'seizures' and no seizure activity was shown. They only found lesions, which are most likely due to a stroke I had at birth.\n\nWent to a three day EEG inside an EMU. Had two 'events' that were not considered seizure activity and was diagnoised with PNES. I don't know how to feel. In a way, I feel like it was a bit rushed, especially as I saw a neurogolist a month before, and he had suggested (after viewing videos) that he thought it was possible that seizures were happening, but so was something else. Despite being diagnoised with PNES, I do wonder if that is what I truly have. And if it is, then why did it suddenly begin now.\n\nI'm not saying you and I were wrongly diagnoised, but I do wonder why we were both diagnoised so quickly. I would think the doctors in the units would have tried 'activing' seizures, to be sure what was found were simply 'events' and not seizure activities. I think we both should have been kept - and you should have been attached to an EEG - for another 2-3 days.

For the last year I've poured over every website, every article, every YouTube video and blog post I could find about epilepsy vs. PNES to try and ""figure out"" what may be going on. \n\nEverything pointed to epilepsy. My seizures simply don't match ANY description I've ever found about PNES, but they DO match with partial focal aware and absence seizures. So I have this cognitive dissonance I'm experiencing where everything that I've learned flies in the face of my experience and yet here I am with this diagnosis that just feels.... wrong.  It's hard to accept it. \n\nDo I have anxiety? Depression? PTSD?--all highly correlated with PNES-- Why yes, yes I do. I'm also autistic. This means there's a decent chance that I have BOTH PNES and epilepsy. I think I'm so convinced that I experience both that I'm fearful of walking out of here with only half the picture. It's expensive, difficult to put it lightly, and downright painful to battle the way to an EMU with our stingy healthcare system and undertrained docs who are more quick to throw AEDs at you as a diagnostic tool than use real science. That said,  I've been waiting nearly a year and I don't ever want to do this again--I'd almost rather take my chances with something like Keppra and see if it helps and illuminates more answers.  \n\nFor now they're putting me on gabapentin to help with my pain and anxiety, which in turn may help reduce the NES. I scoffed at the suggestion of CBT bc I've been doing CBT for trauma since 2016 and if nothing else my NES has gotten WORSE since then, not less. I think I'll try EMDR, I've heard good things and haven't tried it yet. \n\nThe other thing bothering me about this Dx is that it seems the consensus is that PNES is harder to treat bc it's less understood, and as someone who is already a ""very complicated medical case"" and leaves doctors scratching their heads often, I just want an answer that doesn't feel like it's reaching for uber status on the scale of complication.\n\nI don't mean to sound morose or negative or even tone-deaf. I AM grateful to have an answer that's at least validating my sanity and experiences as a whole.  🙃 I'm just having a tough time accepting it as a complete Dx due to said  experiences. I'll admit I'm fearful, too; I lost my driving privs due to this, am on disability, and feel like a shell of myself these days....I guess what I really want is to be assured that this can be controlled and I can drive again and I convinced myself (likely in error) that the road back to ""normal"" was a proper AED instead of a buttload of more therapy and medication cocktails aimed at every mental issue BUT seizures.\n\nAh, well. I'm better off today than I was yesterday and that's a good thing. Thanks for asking this question, I really needed to get that off my chest. 🙏",1663921739,t3_ubtl9o,/r/PNESsupport/comments/ubtl9o/what_emotion_did_you_feel_when_you_received_your/ipkq008/

i5pa0kp,u8zc7s,"Gunna nitpick and say they need to stop calling it pseudo seizures. It's an outdated, dismissive term. It's non-epileptic or psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. JFC. So tired of this term from medical professionals, especially mental health professionals. It's not fake. Stop using the term pseudo. I know, it's just a term and many doctors using this term aren't actually dismissing the disorder. It's still tied to stigmas and does reinforce people who do hold that bias, though. (You don't have to correct anyone on that, but I really felt the need to get that out there.) >.< Ugh! Okay, now that I'm done with my mini rant. lol   \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \nANYWAY! To the more important part!  \n\n\nIMO, yeah, you absolutely should be trying to eliminate the possibly of epilepsy because you can experience both epilepsy and PNES. It's not exactly unheard of, as you can see in this subreddit and the epilepsy sub reddit. Stress, anxiety, depression..all of those things can trigger an epileptic seizure as well. I think it's incredibly responsible of your psychiatrist to recommend you get this done as well.  \n\n\n  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you feel the neurologist will test you appropriately, you might have minimal issues sticking with them *for now.* The neurologist isn't wrong in their line of thinking, but I think it's neglectful to not push to eliminate the possibility of something else happening in the brain. In the meantime while you get these tests done, you could find another neurologist. With a new neurologist, you could have your records from the previous, as well as any other medical records, specifically any your psychiatrist has, sent to the new neurologist. It's exactly what I had to do early on and it was totally worth it. However, that's completely up to you and for you to decide if it's worth it.",1650595691,t3_u8zc7s,/r/PNESsupport/comments/u8zc7s/hi_everyone_not_officially_diagnosed_but_all_my/i5pa0kp/
i60y5k5,u8zc7s,"I just want to say that I have never related to someone's diagnosis more. I have CPTSD (also from severe Childhood Trauma), Major Depressive Disorder and GAD. The only thing I don't have is OCD. I have the same issues of every other doctor believing me except the neurologist. It's really frustrating and I relate with you so much. Though my actual symptoms of Psychogenic seizures are a bit different. At lot of what you described is also what I experience. It's hard going through something that is so unknown and invisible. I hope one day that these symptoms that we and so many other people have will get the same recognition as other serious disorders like Epilepsy. I've noticed a LOT of people who have psychogenic seizures also have C-PTSD or PTSD. I wonder if there is some kind of connect? My advice is that you should change your neurologist. Nothing wrong with a second or even third opinion. Even if you do have quite a few similarities with other people with PNES, it's always still important to rule out epileptic seizures. And there is always the chance of someone having both Epilepsy and PNES. So really important! I hope you will some day find the answers your looking for.",1650822371,t3_u8zc7s,/r/PNESsupport/comments/u8zc7s/hi_everyone_not_officially_diagnosed_but_all_my/i60y5k5/
i5r4e65,u8zc7s,"Thank you so much for such a thoughtful response! I totally understand the misuse of the term pseudo seizures, I’d seen some other people discussing here and there on the CPTSD subreddit as well and it makes a lot of sense, I was just regurgitating the term my therapist used. I’m currently getting an eeg done and mri soon, going thru with the tests regardless of my neuro’s recommendation. She seems to think I’m only having panic attacks, she might be right but the involuntary movement I’ve been seeing is pretty severe and debilitating to my daily life, and kicked up pretty intensely once I started PTSD treatment. \n\nI’m pretty confident I don’t suffer from epilepsy, just want to rule everything out so they can tell me exactly what I have and what the likelihood of the episodes stopping one day, might be. They’ve been going strong for about two months now lol🤣 \n\nI’m going to stick with my current neurologist for this round of testing and then start looking for a new one after that.

I’m in a CPTSD intensive outpatient program and most of my fellow group members experience weird sensations/twitching just nothing as intense as me. It’s crazy how much PTSD affects your nervous system. And my therapist/psych within that program(not my actual psychiatrist or one on one therapist, just for the group) have both said they do see non epileptic seizure activity pretty frequently with PTSD patients. All the technicians and nurses I’ve spoken too in between appts and for tests have also said it sounds like psychogenic seizure activity. I did the eeg and I don’t think we caught anything.

i5f2ik0,u7i3fi,"This is gunna be a bit long but hopefully, this is helpful. <3  \n\n\nFor perspective, I'm diagnosed with PNES, PTSD, Bipolar Type 1, PCOS and Hypothyroidism. Believe me when I say you are NOT alone on this. I'm pretty sure everyone with a seizure disorder and honestly, many disabilities, goes through this at some point in their lives. Your disability may dictate your limitations and it's so hard to navigate this world with disabilities, so all of your emotions, whether you feel hopeless, lost, or anything, is all based on things that are very real. Getting care alone is hard, much less living with things that are unclear on a day to day basis is exhausting. Be kind to yourself. Being young does not mean you cannot have a disability of any sort and especially does not mean you are not deserving of medical assistance, whether it be a mobility aid or at home nurse assistance.  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nIf you're on Facebook, I HIGHLY recommend the group ""the ableds are at it again"". Despite the condescending tone the title has, it's actually a great support group for people of varying disabilities. They allow for people to vent, looking for resources, and all sorts of other neat stuff. There's been several posts about folks with seizures and it's been very queer friendly, in my experience. (I'm a bisexual, gender non conforming person, if that helps for perspective.) You might be able to snag some ideas on helping navigate your day to day life in other ways that we might not think of here.  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \nRegardless if you're diagnosed or not, if you suspect you have PNES, I recommend try reading  ""Taking Control of Your Seizures"" by Joel M Reiter, Donna Andrews, Charlotte Reiter, and W. Curt LaFrance Jr. This was recommended to me by my neurologist and the psychiatrist that helped with my PNES diagnosis. It's a workbook on helping with treatment around your seizures and it's highly recommended for medical professionals who may have to treat patients who have non-epileptic seizures. 10/10 I recommend.  \n\n\n  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \nSupport systems vary for so many different factors including healthcare access and relationship status with people around them, including but not limited to romantic relationships. I'm really sorry you and your partner had to split. Having to go through that is already tough and it sounds like you cared a lot about each other based on how you talked about them. I hope you and your partner can come to a point where things are better for the both of you.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \n\n\nIn terms of ticks, I do have one but it's not during my seizures and it's directly tied to my stress and anxiety levels. Being on more appropriate medications now that I've gotten my Bipolar Type 1 diagnosis has pretty much eliminated that tick. (It was a weird head snapping/jerking motion with a weird shiver that was insanely uncomfortable.)  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nI might be able to get to a point to where I can live alone, but as it stands, I can't. My Bipolar disorder is far from stable, which directly affects my seizures, as we've recently discovered. After manic episodes, I drop *hard*, which also includes me seizing. The body pains and aches from the seizures, my inability to think clearly, to bathe myself, all of that, tends to go out the window. TL;DR - Much of my independence has been stripped from me. However, I'm in a very privileged situation where I have a very caring and trusting partner who, despite his mental struggles, is stable enough to help care for me. When I'm relatively stable, like today, I can handle most things myself, though.  \n\n\n  \n\n\nNot everyone with a seizure disorder has a situation like mine. Some are worse, some are better. It's also really common for people with PNES to suddenly seem like they've been ""cured"" or simply stop having seizures, because sometimes getting that diagnosis helps ease the mind, reducing the anxiety that not having a diagnosis can bring. So, getting a diagnosis might very well be a solution. Much of what you're afraid of now could easily go away once you get your diagnosis, depending on how you and your brain responds to it. Even if you continue to have seizures, you'll have a better idea of what is likely a trigger for you, but you can pinpoint that without a diagnosis, thankfully.  \n\n\n  \n\n\nI do very much feel as though I'm a burden on my partner very often. What helps alleviate that is a combination of maintaining my treatment to minimize seizures, being able to adapt with my partner to changes, and communication. Learning to talk to your partner, platonic or romantic, about the experiences around your fears, as well as giving them space to talk to you about their experience being a caretaker is one of the most important things about that type of dynamic. There are many times where their feelings have to come last, but giving them the appropriate space and tools to help cope is important. It's also about learning how to communicate. My partner never told me I was a burden, but there were other things he has said when I first started having seizures. (We had been together nearly 2 years by that point.) Later, he realized his frustrations weren't with me; it was him being upset with the fact that I had so limited resources and had been basically abandoned by my family. He and I learning what his emotions were, where they stemmed from and how to say it was such a make or break thing for us. It cut our arguments in half. It's made us more affectionate, and it's made understanding our collective disabilities so much more. I still struggle with it very often, but I don't struggle nearly as much with it now that my partner and I have a better understanding of my limitations, his limitations and what our resources are.   \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \nSadly, I don't know anyone who has both PNES and Tourettes, but I'm sure there are people out there with it. I'd try looking around the Tourettes community specifically. That community has some really kind people on TikTok, so I imagine they have a solid community here. Again, might be worth checking out in that Facebook group I mentioned. I'm not educated enough on that disorder in order to say how it may be affecting your potential seizures.  \n\n\n  \n\n\nAs for your HRT, being on T itself isn't necessarily something I've ever heard of triggering a seizure for people with PNES, in and of itself. (I'm NOT a doctor, so I cannot confirm or deny this.) However, if your hormone levels aren't where they should be, as directed by your healthcare providers, the side effects could trigger it, specifically if it's related to stress, sleep deprivation, and other side effects like that. As someone with two hormonal disorders, I can tell you first hand that if you're still experiencing menstrual cycles, TRACK IT. Depending on your menstrual side effects, those side effects could be a trigger. I know some of mine, like headaches and sleep disruption, is one for me. It's why treating my PCOS and Hypothyroidism is so important to me.  \n\n\n  \n\n\nThere's also the fun part of HRT, much like my estrogen treatment, where when they either increase or decrease your dosage. Yeah, that part is fun because it's like a mini puberty, as I like to call it. The changes from that can be something that is a trigger, much like menstrual cycles.  \n\n\n  \n\n\nLearning your triggers is one of the biggest things to not only getting a diagnosis, but also regaining independence. There, of course, is limitations, but once you can pinpoint what those triggers are, you can learn to manage around it while learning to find solutions for those triggers.   \n\n\n  \n\n\nStart logging everything. Your daily moods, diet, medications, socializing habits, exercises, anything. You can be as detailed as you want, but log it all. The other thing that I highly recommend is having anyone you trust to make sure they know in advance to record these events and time them. You want these to show to your doctors because that can be make or break in how soon you get a diagnosis. It GREATLY helped mine, that's for sure.  \n\n\n  \n\n\nSorry for the basically book long details but I hope this helps. <3 Best of luck to you.",1650414610,t3_u7i3fi,/r/PNESsupport/comments/u7i3fi/does_anyone_else_feel_like_they_cant_live_alone/i5f2ik0/

i4giif4,u1r9h3,"I (20 afab enby) absolutely relate to this. I am always aware during my seizures. I can sometimes even speak a few words, though not always. Like you described, I stay awake but can’t control my body. I usually end up making uncontrollable grunting or yelling noises, and if it’s a particularly bad episode my body will also start releasing tears; it’s less like a build up of emotion that causes me to cry and more like my brain is flipping a bunch of random switches trying to find the off button, or something like that. \n\nMine are also heavily triggered by cannabis and psychological distress. I also get the waves of convulsions; my first seizure(s) went on for about an hour and a half and came in waves lasting anywhere from 1-15 minutes at a time. I can usually still force myself to breathe but that can often turn into hyperventilating— it’s like I forget how to breathe during a seizure. \n\nI’m also incredibly groggy for hours, even a day or two afterwards. I get rapid blinking and random eye movement instead of being unable to blink though. As far as sense of time goes, I kind of feel the opposite. I’ll feel like I’ve been seizing for an hour when it’s only been a few minutes. \n\nYou’re absolutely not faking it; PNES attacks just present differently from epileptic seizures. I joke that my brain is guessing what an epileptic seizure is supposed to be like, and then trying to copy that but going wayyyyyy overboard.\n\nUnfortunately, to people who don’t really understand the difference between an epileptic and non-epileptic attack, it can look to them like you’re faking it.

i296fr8,touci4,"  This is my first time of me commentating on this issue. I have been lookin' forward to someday sharing my experiences and hopefully help someone. \n\nFirst off, I'd like to start off by recommending a [book](https://www.amazon.com/Psychogenic-Non-epileptic-Seizures-Lorna-Myers/dp/1492881414/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=psychogenic+non-epileptic+seizures+a+guide&qid=1648333519&sprefix=pcychogenic%2Caps%2C282&sr=8-1) called ""Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures: A Guide"" by Lorna Myers Ph.D.\n\n A little background of myself. I'm 25y/o male. I have been diagnosed with Anxiety (I can never recall which type), Bipolar, Borderline Personality Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, OCD, ADD, and conversion Disorder, to name a few.. I've been to the hospital for my episodes more times than I can count. I've seen more specialist than I can count. One of the appointments I waited about 5-6months for at OHSU. It was about an hour-long drive, then another hour for the doctor, then an hour-long explanation of what I've already been told before that can be summed up with, all of what I would've done has already been done, there isn't much more I can do. I say this not to discourage but to show I know how frustrating it can be.\n\n One of the main factors that really convinces me that it was Conversion Disorder and P.N.E.S. that I was dealing with was it comin' on when work was gettin' devastatingly stressful and becoming increasingly so and had so sign of stopping. I was workin' at an assisted livin' during the time of these symptoms coming up. I loved workin' with the residents but the stress of management was overwhelming; they were shady and irresponsible and put the health and safety of the Elderly at risk all the time. They also had me workin' while my hands burned and bled while workin'.\n\n   The first time I had an episode, it was as if my legs just suddenly stopped workin'. I was home pettin' my roommates cat on the edge of my bed when I suddenly got really dizzy and went down to the floor. Fortunately, I was on my knees at the time. Unfortunately my phone was on the table in the dining room so I had to make my way over there partially an army and partially like a lea lion. Despite bein' really confused of why this would be happenin', I still stayed positive and do what I normally do and kind of commentated myself out loud as if I was in a satire film of some sort because stress wasn't goin' to help anythin' and just be thankful that I've got an amazing friend that lived in the same apartment complex that knew a thing or two about the anatomy and would be right over once I gave them a call. \n\n  Besides stress, another correlation, I have a found was that many of times it happens in the evening when I am home and tryin' to relax. Because of them typically occuring in the evening, I feel as though the stress throughout the day is kinda bottled up and then thrown at myself as a molotov cocktail.  I hope that makes.\n\n As far as techniques go, I try to keep track when it happens and the possible why. When I feel like I *might* have one comin' on, I will use the restroom, and get myself a cup of water and lay down, or least find a comfortable spot that I will stay seated at until the feeling goes away because I know that the last thing I need is to fall and hit my head yet again. If I feel like it could be awhile before I am confident enough to get up without potentially falin' and that I'm  beginnin' feelin' hungry, I have to remind myself to just grab a nature valley bar (or somethin' of the sort) instead because makin' myself a full meal is not worth the risk of fallin' and hurtin' my head.\n\n When I got to the point that I decided I was goin' to put my two weeks in whether or not I had another job lined up because I had had enough (honestly should've been when I had an episode at work that ended with me bein' takin' away in an ambulance). Fortunately, I got hired at a place that I couldn't believe was goin' to be my escape and got to start right when I left my previous job. This is one of the suggestions that is in that book that involved using what control you have over the environment around you so it is less stressful. This worked wonders for the longest time. My episodes went *way* **down** other than fatigue and vertigo but bein' paralyzed and unable to move felt like it could actually be a thing of the pass. \n\n  That was until my Grandmother passed away and I had one at the memorial service while I was sittin' on the pew. For the longest time, no one noticed because during this time, I was front row lookin' forward, frozen, like a stature, unable to not much more than my eyes.  When they did notice me, my mom felt bad but when she asked me if I wanted to layed down so I could rest, I used quite a bit of energy to nod my head ever so softly. When I was out, I had an experience that the best way I can describe was that I paid a visit to my Grandma in my head as if I traveled back in time (since she hadn't been livin' in her house in years) though I was the same age. During this time, it was as if there was an intercom of what I was hearin' in the real world. It was quite the experience. I eventually came to in the hospital, and when I eventually got home, I slept for 13 hours.\n\n   I apologize for havin' such a long response, I didn't think I would end up typin' near this much but regardless, I hope this helps. \n\n The most basic suggestions would be\n\n* Stay hydrated\n* Try [breathing techniques](https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/breathing-to-reduce-stress)\n* Try out the app ""**Bearable**"" to keep track of stress, meds, energy, and other variables\n* Keep calm (I know the struggle) ""Your mind is like this water, my friend. When it is agitated it becomes difficult to see, but if you allow it to settle, the answer becomes clear"" -Oogway\n* Don't give up (I know that one far too well) “The man who moves a mountain begins by carrying away small stones.” – Confucius.    Just in case stress gets to the extreme, here is [this](https://www.crisistextline.org/) as well. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions and I'll do my best to help out. I'm not a professional but at least I have personal hands on experience that have the potential to help. It should be noted as well that I am a work of progress so I am by no means an expert. \n\n Here's to a better tomorrow.\n\n \~T.",1648339277,t3_touci4,/r/PNESsupport/comments/touci4/does_this_sound_like_pnes_im_waiting_for_a/i296fr8/

There’s a lot of variety in this condition.\n\nI was diagnosed about seven years ago. It started when I was five, and I’m nearly 50. For me, it increased when I was 40, and my heart and vasovagal syncope (passing out) were ruled out as part of the diagnosis. I’d been misdiagnosed as epileptic until 40 when things got much worse.\n\nI have a history of trauma and head trauma, complicating the issue.\n\nSo to answer your question, yes what you’re going through does seem familiar, as someone who has been through it and ended up with a PNES diagnosis.\n\nHang in there.

The reason you can’t think well is that the brain is very tired. Maybe search on internet/YT for a video of brain activity during a seizure.

i10hde4,tg1d01,"I’m so sorry your family is facing this monster! I don’t personally suffer from PNES, but my friend does and I work in the epilepsy/PNES world (and have for several years now). \n\nFirstly, it is very, very common for seizure frequency to spike when treatment starts. That is pretty typical and by no means predictive of future seizure frequency. Treatment involves a lot of recognition, discussion, and whatnot of seizure triggers after all. She may be able to return to work and regain her independence, just not right at this very moment. The important thing is that she focuses on her current task and goal.\n\nSecondly, not what you asked for but what might be generally helpful information from a distance Ohio does have a fair number of resources in comparison to other states, so your mom has some assistance there. For instance, in Cincinnati, there’s a grant-funded (read: completely free) [Stress Center](https://www.uchealth.com/stress-center/) for anybody who carries a diagnosis of PTSD, which a lot of people with PNES also have. If getting her to and from appointments is a concern, there are [assistance options](https://www.ohiomh.com/documents/transportationassistance.pdf) including more[local services](https://www.go-metro.com/accessibility/access-program).\n\nThirdly, it sounds like you are being very conscientious about your mother’s care and she is lucky to have you in her life.

i140i6z,tg1d01,"I’m happy to offer support—we all need it at some point in our lives, after all.\n\nThoughts on helping her avoid withdrawing further:\n\n-does she have an Apple Watch, Samsung watch, or Fitbit? I don’t know what her seizures entail, but if they involve her heart racing, you could set her up with an app like [this](https://www.rscme.com) as an alert to keep her safe. If her seizures involve a lot of shaking movements, then an app like [this](https://smart-monitor.com/inspyre/) would be a better option. That might set her mind at ease that if she’s having a seizure, people she wants informed will know and get her location, too.\n\n-I hate to be a broken record, but [support groups](https://www.nami.org/Support-Education/Support-Groups/NAMI-Connection) are really helpful for a lot of people. \n\n-It may sound corny, but I find tai chi really does wonders for the people in my life with high anxiety. It’s totally anecdotal, but I’ve seen a lot of relief in my loved ones. A lot of places even have free classes in the park during the summer.\n\n-Meet Ups focusing on mental health wellness and mindfulness may not be helpful in and of themselves, but may help give her a community of people who know what it is to struggle and can empathize with her experience.\n\n-Public library or local college will have interesting programs for her to attend that are free and typically accessible via public transportation (if available). They also tend to have such a wide range of offerings that it’s easy to find at least one or two things that appeal (maybe a poetry reading and a student photo exhibit?). \n\n-This is asking a lot, but could you be her remote wingman on an outing or two? Maybe another loved one could help instead? She can use the phone as a crutch to make it to her destination and accomplish her goal, so someone is with her and knows where she is. \n\n-you mentioned exercising outdoors in your post. Maybe instead of hiking in the woods, she might feel safer jogging on the track at the local high school where people would be able to get to her and keep her safe if she had a seizure? Maybe also exercising with a buddy?\n\n-She shouldn’t feel like she needs to do everything all at once—that’s a ton of pressure! Set goals and break them down into even smaller, more manageable steps. Instead of getting back out and about being completely independent, she could focus just on going grocery shopping. Then breaking that down by making a shopping list, then dividing that list up by location in the shop, then envisioning the process of walking through the store and putting those items in her cart.

hx5k63q,sivjpz,"One year ago I took a strong dose of psilocybin in the form of magic truffles for the third time in my life. A week or two after my trip I started noticing debilitating PNES symptoms for the first time (although I had a few rare episodes prior to ever consuming psilocybin). I feel like the trip could have triggered something in my brain. During that trip I tried to embrace some of my past trauma but didn't really make contact with it. I think that perhaps some of this brain stress or trauma was activated or provoked during the trip and now that stress/trauma has manifested in my body creating PNES symptoms. If I was you, I would be overly cautious about taking psilocybin -- especially out of a therapeutic environment. If you want to get the most out of its therapeutic benefits, I would consider going to a professional therapeutic retreat where someone can facilitate and guide the experience so that you not only provoke your brain stress but that you have a psychologist to help you guide it. In the Netherlands, psilocybin is legal (in the form of magic truffles) and there are many professional retreats run by psychologists.

htnnzon,s96rs2,"It's definitely worth talking to your doctor about. Excuse my language, but absofuckinglutely log it in as much detail as possible. Have someone, whether it's you or someone  else, record any activity you can physically see. Show it  to your doctor.  \n\n\n  \nKeep in mind that seizures, regardless of what type you have, are stressful. I have PNES and I have a similar experience in my right leg. There has been no evidence from all of the tests I've experienced that there is anything neurologically wrong, though.   \n\n\n  \nIt could be a result of the stress PNES is putting on your body. Anxiety and stress in and of itself can cause responses in the body such as numbing in limbs, muscle spasms and all sorts of things. Stress and anxiety are commonly a trigger for seizures, including PNES. The way my neurologist and psychiatrist who diagnosed me with PNES explained PNES to me was that PNES was essentially an extreme panic attack. (They generally don't call it that because not only the extreme experience of it for patients and how it effects their lives, but the stigma around mental health related issues, such as panic attacks, according to those two doctors.)  \n\n\n  \nIn short, it could be PNES or it could be something else. Letting your doctor know all of the details surrounding this experience to eliminate if it's connected to your seizures or not is important in your diagnosis process. If your doctor already suspects PNES, it's a possibility you experience what I and others experience; it's a side effects from the stress on your body.  \n\n\n  \n\n\nIn the meantime, be easy on yourself when you experience it. What helps me, but this may not help you, is to lay down, and slowly stretch my leg as if I'm trying to stretch out a charlie horse type cramp until it alleviates enough to stand, take a small dose of ibruprofen and drink water a lot of water.

ht8ztl1,s701s7,"So, I don't have much for solutions, but I'll give you my experience in the shortest way possible while also giving some recommendations that may help things along. Here's my medical conditions that effect my seizures in one way or another: Hypothyroidism, PCOS, Bipolar Disorder, PTSD, anxiety disorder.  \n\n\nLet me also preface this with that, as confirmed by a psychiatrist who specializes in PNES and other similar disorders, most folks, once they get their diagnosis, see a significant drop in seizures, and sometimes intensity of the seizure. Part of it is because of the mental struggle of everything involving being medically validating, but it also usually comes with the conclusion as to \*what\* is triggering them. While not exactly ""curable"", it is very much a treatable disorder.   \n\n\n  \nYou mentioned grand mal seizure. Is he diagnosed with a neurological seizure disorder or is that merely a description for it? I ask just for clarification. Either way, yes, stress and anxiety can trigger PNES, but it can also be a trigger for a neurological seizure. Only a neurologist will be able to rule out of it's a neurological disorder or not. I went through EKGs, short term and long term EEGS (my longest was at the hospital for roughly 72 hours), CT scans and some other stuff. For my 72 hour EEG, the goal was to trigger a seizure intentionally to see what type it was, so they took me off my AEDs, which are also mood balancers, forced me into sleep deprivation, used lighting patterns, and tried to basically stress me out in as many ways as they humanely could within reasonable means. Part of my care team included a psychiatrist who specializes in dealing with PNES and other similar conditions. He and my neurologist were the ones that diagnosed me, not my usual psychiatrist.  \n\n\n  \nIn terms of finding a psychiatrist, absolutely find a psychiatrist who, at MINIMUM, is willing to learn about PNES. My neurologist and hospital psychiatrist recommended my usual psychiatric care team to read ""Taking Control of Your Seizures"" by Joel M Reither, Donna Andrews, Charlotte Reither, and W. Curt LaFrane Jr. I HIGHLY recommend it for you to read as well.  \n\n\n  \nAs recommended above, a seizure journal, but honestly, a journal overall.  \nHere's what helped me rule out a lot of things early on with the doctor.  \n1) We made sure my thyroid was balanced and my reproductive parts were ""healthy"" or functioning as they should be. I continued to have seizures despite this, but it did reduce some of my seizures once my thyroid was balanced out. I had to track my menstrual cycles with this, but assuming I'm assuming your son isn't trans. In the event they are, still continue to track this.  \n\n\n2) Tracked my diet in my journal, less concerned with a ""healthy"" diet and more so just sharing with my doctors what I was eating to find potential trigger foods. I was very specific on my caffeine intake more than anything.  \n\n\n3) Tracked my daily moods. Didn't necessarily go into detail. Always tried to keep it in simple terms, like depressed, happy, etc. Included if I had suicidal thoughts, extreme feelings of joy and happiness, energy drops/increases, etc.  \n\n\n4) Tracked daily activities, such as gym routines, social outings, etc.  \n\n\n5) Track BP and, if possible, maybe even sugar levels. If it seems to be normal for the most part, only track these things around the seizures themselves.  \n\n\n6) Write down anything and everything pertaining to the seizure itself; did he potty on himself? (I know that sounds silly, but it's relevant.) did he have a headache? What did that headache feel like? How did his body feel? What were the body aches like? Where exactly were the body aches; were they all over or only in certain general regions? was he dizzy, nauseous, able to hear, speak, and understand when he was spoken to? What all could he hear? Did he remember anything leading up to the seizure? What was his overall vision like before and after? Did he smell anything in particular, like phantom smells? Can he swallow water on his own? Any numbness? Can he follow and understand basic commands, such as holding up his hand when you lift  it? Was he disoriented/able to tell you basic info, like his name or the date?  \n\n\n  \n\n\nSomething else I HIGHLY recommend you do, especially for the neurologist, is to RECORD the seizure. Witnessing one can be very traumatic. It may seem very cold hearted to sit by and record a seizure, as if he were some form of spectacle, but I promise, if you can get anyone watching to record it and show the doctor, it'll greatly help, not only in finding a diagnosis, but it's helpful when a doctor begins to doubt his condition, because I promise, SOMEONE will at some point. On top of recording it, check his BP whether you do it manually or use an at home mechanism.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese were some of the things that not only helped me with my PNES diagnosis, but it helped with my recent diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder. Knowing he's dealing with such extreme anxiety, he may just have an anxiety disorder, OR it could be another underlying mental illness. Keep in mind, mental illnesses like Bipolar Disorder isn't a form of moral failing. Many of them are strictly chemical imbalances, just like with Hypothyroidism or Diabetes, but specific to certain parts of the brain is all. These CAN be triggered by social/real life issues, head trauma, other medical trauma, or even genetics. Even ones that are a result of emotional/mental trauma, it's still not a moral failing on his or your part. (Unless you were the abuser, but based on your concern, I'm heavily inclined to not think you are.) For some people, like myself, getting appropriate medication and coping mechanisms for my disorder has significantly reduced not only the number of seizures I have, but their intensity.  \n\n\n  \n\n\n I know this was long, but it's everything I could think of off the  top of my head. Hope this helps!",1642550581,t3_s701s7,/r/PNESsupport/comments/s701s7/stress_induced_seizures_is_this_pnes_help/ht8ztl1/

Both times he went into another seizure that was stopped by medical professionals. He seemed ok once he came out of them.

I only take it once a day now. I started DBT therapy to help me be mindful of my emotions and pay more attention on how it makes me body react. I also found that discussing undisclosed trauma I had experienced in my teen years (seizures started around that time) with my spouse and therapist helped me get some closure and seizures have gone from happening nearly every day to none at all. I am over half way through my third round of TMS treatments now and have been doing fantastic. I am more active and productive around the house, my energy levels have increased, and I’m feeling much happier. These seizures are caused by stress and now that I have that in check I think it’s smooth sailing from here.

hpg4kvy,rkp9ep,"Hey friend I too get panic attacks and have PNES. It’s definitely something you should discuss with a doctor- I personally speak to my psychiatrist, therapist and my pcp. It can feel very confusing especially when you don’t know what’s happening. Even now for me someone who has had sporadic  episodes since 2015 it’s a hard distinction at times knowing which is about to happen/ has happened. From my experience there are a couple of signs- I’ll randomly notice a part of my body that has that numb/ tingly sensation(sometimes hours before it even happens, I write it down just incase that random sensation is in fact relevant). normally I think I’m about to have a panic attack prior to the seizure but there’s something extremely worse about the feeling- I have a few seconds before I lose control over my body (I have just enough time to realize somethings wrong and lay down or to myself identify like I have that pre panic attack feeling). It’s almost the same off sensation where everything feels out of place and that initial panic sets in ( for me I get sweaty/ hot things just feel wrong and then I become almost hyper aware of my heartbeat breathing the way things feel) . Only difference with a panic attack is I’m aware throughout its entirety I feel everything that is happening in that moment. When it comes to the seizure i have that panic attack feeling and I blank.I wake up with memory gaps, a raging headache feeling very panicked, my body feels sore, and I find myself feeling so cold with shivers. But I have no recollection until I start piecing together little bits of information. Even then I notice for a day or two my mind feels very scattered and confused. Since I used to have a lot of panic attacks it became habitual the moment I noticed the change in perception of my environment I’d record. And to my luck my latest seizure I caught on camera granted i didn’t see the video till a day later but I think there something feeling validating knowing there was a reason for the way I / my body felt the way that it did.  it didn’t leave me in the dark- for once I saw this very real thing that was happening to me and it gave me a second to kinda slow down and process how I felt about it. Although it left me with questions it was in a  less judgmental way towards myself and more along the lines of how can I help myself, how can I make sure (since we don’t get control in how/ when these things happen) that I can can make sure I feel / am safe, what are ways I can cope with this and how do I move forward. The truth is that looks different for everyone and sure can be a tough thing to go through alone.  I hope you are able to find support and resources that help you figure out what’s going on/ how to move forward.  I truly believe support, learning triggers and recognizing that None of it is your fault is very important in processing and navigating this.

hpmq0i2,rkp9ep,"Well I don’t know if it’s the exact moment it started but in 2015 I contracted the West Nile virus, I was really really sick and no one knew what was wrong with me. So they did a lumbar puncture because they were running of options and I’m not too sure if this was before or after that moment but I fell into a coma like state and started having seizures. They did the tests.nothing. I was in the hospital for a long while. Once I got better and became aware again they put me on seizure medication as a preventative for a little over a year. I made the decision as a 15 yr old that I did not want to go to therapy despite what the doctors recommended to my parents. I just wanted to forget it ever happened and it caught up to me 2 years later a bit after I got diagnosed with lupus. After the first time I really didn’t think it would happen again I had no memory off it really I thought if I just pretended I was good that I’d be good. But after that time I saw a neurologist again and they told me I need to see a psychiatrist and speak to a therapist because it’s a lot especially for a teenager to process.

hocf4tl,rey09r,"Absence seizure:\n\n“An indication of simple absence seizure is a vacant stare, which may be mistaken for a lapse in attention that lasts about 10 seconds, though it may last as long as 20 seconds, without any confusion, headache or drowsiness afterward. Signs and symptoms of absence seizures include:\n\nSudden stop in motion without falling\nLip smacking\nEyelid flutters\nChewing motions\nFinger rubbing\nSmall movements of both hands\nAfterward, there's no memory of the incident. Some people have many episodes daily, which interfere with school or daily activities.”\n\nMy PNES events manifest as dissociative blackouts.   My hippocampi stop functioning properly, and no memory is formed during an event.  It’s like a switch; I suddenly cease to exist.  During the event (2 to 20 minutes long), everyone tells me I’m still “me”, just confused.  There are no physical impairments, and I can carry on a conversation, though I may repeat the same questions, because I can’t remember the answers I was just given.  Whatever I’m doing when the event starts, I keep doing.  They also tell me I am aware something is wrong, but don’t know what it is.\n\nWhen I come out of it, I’m confused, but I know I’ve had a PNES event, and always contact my husband.  He says PNES is just my brain rebooting.  It takes awhile for the confusion to clear.  I have only chatted with one other person who has events similar to mine, and I have no idea how common it is.

Also, to be clear, I say this as someone with diagnosed GAD.  \n\n\nYou need to stop posting here. You are feeding your anxiety by constantly looking this up and constantly looking for validation or concern from communities and people with seizures. If any of us say ""yea that sounds worrying you should talk to your doctor"" or anything remotely similar, that is only going to feed your obsessive health anxiety, because it validates your fear. You need to disconnect from communities like this and try to seek out therapy and treatment for your anxiety disorder instead. Because you've never had a seizure, it isn't necessary to pursue EEGs or any epileptic testing or resources. If you're worried about stressing yourself into a seizure then you need to focus on managing your stress, not on feeding your fear of seizures.   \n\n\nThat list of comorbid conditions you posted is far from exclusive to PNES.

Roughly 2-33 people have PNES for every 100 000 people in the US. That's 0.00002 - 0.00033 %.

I'm saying your advice isn't helpful.   \n\n\nYour age is relevant, even if you don't see it. The older you get the more you get to see your own advice and beliefs in action, and see how often they do or do not pan out. When I was 17 I had the same exact attitude you have. Your intentions are good but you're not able or willing to see all sides of the issue, and you lack a certain amount of life experience of seeing how other people experience and deal with struggles differently than how you do. In short, and I'm not saying this to be mean, I mean it just as a matter of fact, but age has a direct relationship with naivety. You cannot just ""stop thinking"" about things that massively stress you out.

I haven't found any medicine that does, but if I perform some numeric process in my head (e.g. counting primes), it sometimes holds it off. Unfortunately, if I do this I'll usually have a more severe episode later.\n\nI categorize my episodes into minor, moderate, major, and severe. In a minor episode I'll thrash my arm/leg about or my teeth will chatter. In a moderate episode I go down, with full body thrashing, although I usually remain conscious throughout. A major episode involves a loss of consciousness and time loss, plus a weariness lasting hours, but is otherwise the same as a moderate episode. A severe episode leaves me exhausted and with memory/time loss of a few minutes beforehand, and often requires hours of sleep.

hsbrq5d,r7m89h,"My story.\n\nStarted having attacks in 2001. Docs thought it was epilepsy. AEDs either didn't work or negative side effects. Freq. 4-8 simple partial seizures (motor/painful/stressful) a month. Two tonic-clonic seizures lasting over 30 mins in 20 years. Epi clinic diagnosed PNES.\n\nI've had periods of seizure remission. But generally they are very, very predictable (I'm lucky).\n\nLamotrigine: I was put on 25mg late October. To date, I've had one seizure. I was up to 100mg at some point and I will probably go as high as 200mg if the seizures return.\n\nSide-effects: none, except itching all over. Sunburn-like itch in face for 2-3 days once in a while. No rash thus far.\n\nWhy do I think they work for me? I think they are mood-stabilizing, they work for migraines, and are anticonvulsive (for epilepsy). I think it's a good avenue to try, i.e. give it 6 months and see. Keep a diary.\n\nYou mentioned you don't have trauma. I'd like to say here that it doesn't matter. It's often called ""psychogenic"" and people tie that to some sort of pathological mental condition.\n\nYou don't need to have traumas or visible mental issues. Every brain is different. And so are internal subconscious coping mechanisms. A simple trigger can be being under stress at work and ignoring the issue, without letting it get you upset but staying focused on the job. The fact that you're ignoring it might initiate a process, which you are not aware of, that can trigger a seizure two weeks later. It doesn't always have to be a serious event but a lot of small, seemingly irrelevant events combined with less than optimal coping skills. I play guitar for 30 years and just recently ended up with a nickel allergy. At some point your body just has had enough.\n\nA simple test you can perform on yourself is by asking yourself, ""How do I feel exactly? Right now, what are my feelings?"". Alexithymia is often a co-morbidity of PNES. \n\nHope that helps! Take care and be good to yourself.",1641976976,t3_r7m89h,/r/PNESsupport/comments/r7m89h/lamictal/hsbrq5d/

hjrt3wv,qhpei0,"The way that my doctor explained it is PNES is the way your brain copes with stress or trauma. This is similar to a panic attack because the panic part is your brain coping with anxiety. Some none mental examples is a headache when dehydrated or your stomach hurting when hungry. Your brain controls your whole body and it often has physical symptoms for non physical things.\n\nTo answer you question, a seizure wouldn't be classified as a panic attack but it is similar as your brain is trying to cope with something. However, I have had a panic attack that led to a seizure mostly due to what triggered the seizure such as a flashback or a really stressful situation.\n\nEveryone's seizures are different but learning this helped me better control them. I have had panic attacks for almost 15 years and I had to learn how to control them.

hgnfoe5,q7qie2,"Ok.  This is gonna be wordy.  I have had all of these since early childhood, and they are interconnected.  I was born very preemie in a small hospital in the 1960s.  There were no drugs to speed up the development of my body and brain, no machines to keep me alive while I “caught up”, except an incubator.  I was in that for almost six weeks.  For the first full year of my life, I was not allowed to sleep for more than two hours at a time (various reasons).  Doctors have told me that if I had been full term, these disorders may not have happened.\n\n1.  Insomnia:  sleep onset and sleep maintenance.  This means I have a hard time getting to sleep, and I can’t stay asleep (fully waking 6-10 times each night).  I take a prescribed antihistamine every night, which helps.\n\n2.  Apnea (mild).  I have partial obstruction (started in my forties) and centrals (from birth).  “Centrals” are when my brain forgets to tell my diaphragm to move, thus my lungs don’t breath.  These also happen occasionally when I’m awake.   I sleep with a CPAP machine which helps tremendously.  \n\n3.  Circadian Rhythm Disorder.  Because of the sleep disruption of my first year, my biological clock basically never got set.  \n\n4.  Dreams, dreams, dreams!  I don’t know what it’s called, but I start to dream too soon after falling asleep, I dream in all stages of sleep and remember them, and my dreams (even nice ones) are extremely vivid and intense.  Sleep isn’t very restful.   As a kid, I had hypnagogia (start dreaming before being completely asleep), but that rarely happens now.   I had Complex PTSD, and as it built over the years, these dream problems got worse.  Once I completed twenty months of weekly EMDR therapy, this got somewhat better.  \n\nSo, there ya go.

I’ve been taking Prazosin for about 8 months now to help with the nightmares and it’s been a tremendous help! Kind of gets me in a decent spot during the times I am sleeping on a decent schedule.

hey0lga,pypadr,"Both other comments are wonderful and I 100% agree!  Please don't beat yourself down, and please seek therapy for someone you click with to talk to!  I would have lost all sanity if I hadn't had found my therapist when I did.\n\nI was very similar to you, I developed PNES at 19 ontop of other chronic illnesses and tried going to college at 20 yrs old and it just didn't work, BUT, I was undiagnosed at that time and had absolutely no help or assistance, including therapy or medication, and lived in an abusive situation.  I know doctors are virtually useless sometimes, that's why I really stress therapists familiar with cognitive behaviors and/or a psychiatrist who can better explain the condition to you.  You CAN do college and all the things you want to do but understand that health is a priority and a unique journey for all of us, and if you decide that taking a break from college is best, it doesn't make you a failure or mean you can't ever try again once you get the care you need! \n\nNow I'm here 10 years later, I have a very good handle on my PNES compared to where I was, and all things considered, I'm a very normal, happy, and productive person.  PNES does not mean by any means that you are permanently disabled or can't feel 'normal' or do 'normal things' other people do.  I think the word 'disabled' is always misinterpreted to mean damaged or broken and that you can never have things that normal abled people have. I definitely couldn't do some 'normal' things in the very beginning of my journey with it and it's completely normal and OK for you to be that way too!  \n\nHaving any type of medical condition, not just PNES, means we have to take more care and time to find treatments and things that work for us to get us where we want to be.  For example, my sleep disorder can work in tandem with my PNES to trigger seizures so I work jobs that allow me to set my hours to accommodate for my sleep issues.  I learned that heat exhaustion can trigger my seizures so when I'm doing intense sports or exercise, I make sure to have a few cold packs on hand and a good insulated bottle of very cold water.  High sugar or caffeine can trigger twitching, so I always make sure to order without at restaurants.  Having a dog or cat to pet significantly helps my twitching and seizures.  These are all really small things that make a big difference to me and no one would ever know unless I told them. \n\nSo it's good to keep in mind that many people have chronic illnesses, physical and mental, and many triggers, and you pass by them everyday on the street without ever realizing.  Plenty of these people lead wonderful and 'normal' lives but everyone is in a different place on their journey and it's pointless to compare, so please don't beat yourself down!",1633067175,t3_pypadr,/r/PNESsupport/comments/pypadr/so_im_disabled/hey0lga/

hdzi8ov,pssn01,"Patient. I've been inflicted for about 25 years or so. Fortunately my symptoms started out minor, remaining largely unnoticed for about a decade. Then I suffered a Gran Mal without any warning while at dinner. Scared and embarrassed, I began a series of tests to figure out what's going on. Most neurologists ruled out epilepsy, but then just shrugged and said good luck. After a few years I found help from the Cleveland Clinic, which was able to diagnose me with conversion disorder. Unfortunately, this is a very broad category, and at the time there were no specialists for PNES (or at least none they knew of). \n\nSince then I began to try and research it, but knowledge was limited. Every so often I'd take another look, especially as my condition progressed. When I found a psychiatrist willing to take a crack at it, I had to explain everything to her.

PNES does not show that excessive electrical activity because it is caused by something else. PNES is diagnosed when a person has an episode while being monitored on EEG. The seizure (without epileptic electrical activity) is proof of the diagnosis and will go in a patient’s chart as such.

hdcj8kp,pqbn24,"Yeah, I work in a place that’s very ‘disability confident’ and my coworkers are very accommodating, caring and welcoming for the most part. I work alone in the kitchen most of the time in a small café, but a few people have witnessed my absence seizures and then also my quiet or even aggressive post-ictal period where I either shut down or become quite bitey. \n\nI think what’s most important is finding a workplace that is accommodating first of all, the main issue is I have to summarise it as “a form of epilepsy” first of all — no one actually knows what PNES is! And if someone asks any further then I explain that it’s not quite epilepsy. \n\nIn the UK, I have protection as my disability is diagnosed and by default is a protective characteristic. Your employers are liable for any misconduct and discrimination. Your highest manager will definitely know this, so make sure to speak to them about it if you haven’t already. They should be able to directly communicate it to your management team.\n\nIf your episodes are public, make sure you’ve explained to your coworkers you have no control over them. If you experience absense seizures, or tic-like (like mouth clicking) episodes then explain them as tics. \n\nI also have terrible vertigo! I don’t even have a fear of heights really, it’s the fact that whenever I go on a high surface I feel like I’m falling. Vertigo is a trigger for me. Make it clear to your coworkers that you struggle with it.\n\nI’m pretty sure vertigo and PNES are directly linked and more research should be done for it. I think vertigo is a common symptom, rather than a comorbid disorder. Individuals with vertigo have a high propensity for other mental health conditions as well as far as I know from personal experience, it can even be a trauma response. I’d definitely investigate that within yourself. Do you have vertigo because of heights, or is it triggered by sensory overload? Was there one time you first experienced vertigo, and are your other episodes any similar?\n\nThose are all my triggers as well, but caffeine and stimulants (particularly and specifically when I take too much) are triggers for me too.\n\nLack of consciousness is related to blood pooling in the feet and lack of oxygen in the brain. \n\nSo many signs point to PNES being a blood problem, instead of a neurological problem, but equally as severe and uncontrollable.",1631982607,t1_hdc3v5f,/r/PNESsupport/comments/pqbn24/deleted_by_user/hdcj8kp/

hd9q7fp,pqa7st,"So I've had PNES for 10 years now, couldn't agree more on how under researched it is for something that is so underdiagnosed.  I just joined this sub but the solidarity is helping me so much. \n\nMy seizures are almost exactly like yours when they are more serious and last for an hour or more.  I had these the most averaging around 4 hours almost daily seizures when I first developed PNES.  For me, my body will always get to a point where the 'energy' finally gets all out and I'm extremely exhausted and pass out/have a couple hour nap.  I tried multiple drugs by my psych to prevent and stop an ongoing seizure but nothing worked for me, I don't believe I was ever given xanax to try but I was given several anti-anxiety medications for it.  I completely understand and encourage you to get off it and find an alternative, no matter how hard it is or how much work it takes in the beginning. \n\nLook into treatments like CBT and EFT and continue seeing a therapist if you are, if you aren't, I highly recommend those three treatment options first. Telehealth is very accessible now so you don't have to worry about leaving home for these.  I don't know if you live with someone, but once I had a seizure and my partner began slowly dragging his hands from the base of my skull down my spine with a little pressure almost like a massage.  Doing this a few times had a significant effect for me and it felt like my nerves were being 'reset' or switched back into place and my seizure calmed down very quickly.  That's still the most effective thing I've ever experienced for stopping a seizure.\n\nOther things I've done during seizures because no drugs worked for me, were finding something very simple to train my focus on to bring me out of my dissociation and calm down my muscles.  Disney or Ghibli movies ended up being a very good one for me, just make sure it has no disturbing or too dark of themes (or sound or light stimulus) because your brain is extremely vulnerable in that state.  Also if you have animals, cats and dogs just being near or petting or cuddling if you have the motor control are significantly helpful, especially in lowering heart rate.  If you don't have animals, I highly suggest getting a cat.  \n\nTo prevent seizures, I like to keep something regular with exercise or blood circulation, even if its just walking or stretching.  Healthy diet and nothing like artificial sugars, chemicals or caffeine (and be careful with vitamin B!) are a huge help to me.  Someone mentioned earlier that low blood sugar can also cause them which is absolutely true.  A good sleep and hygiene routine is a big help, even if you can just do little tasks around the home, reward and praise yourself and really prioritize self care and things that make you feel comfy.  I also find focusing on creative projects or reading will keep my brain in a state that isn't susceptible to seizures.\n\nAnd above all, seek therapy and treatments that get all the trauma out (assuming yours is also PTSD-related).  The body (and this goes for animals too) is designed to physically shake like this when experiencing trauma to release it, so imo for most people, their seizures are due to stress and trauma, whether its ongoing, leftover or both.  You are being pushed too much and this is the body's way of release because you aren't consciously able to.  It's akin to how we throw up when we ingest something poisonous. \n\nI hope some of that was able to help!  I hope you feel better and if you need anything feel free to DM me any time!",1631921958,t3_pqa7st,/r/PNESsupport/comments/pqa7st/pnes_for_7_years_now/hd9q7fp/
hdaleh3,pqa7st,"I’ve had PNES for six years.  Probably caused by a convergence of evils:  multiple lifelong sleep disorders, sleep apnea, and Complex PTSD.   I now have meds to treat the sleep disorders, a CPAP machine for the apnea, and I went through 20 months of EMDR therapy for the C-PTSD.  \n\nMy events do not resemble epilepsy at all.  First, I was diagnosed with Transient Global Amnesia.  Then changed to epilepsy.  Finally my epileptologist diagnosed PNES.  We think that during a PNES event, one or both of my hippocampi stop working.   If both are affected, then it feels like I cease to exist because memory stops forming entirely.  I am told that I know who I am, I recognize my loved ones, but there are holes in my memory.  Whatever I’m doing when the event starts, I keep doing, as long as it’s a familiar task (though I may repeat a step or two).  I’m still me, but confused, and they tell me that I’m aware something is wrong, but don’t know what.  I’m never upset or worried during an event.  When it’s over, I’m suddenly “back”, but still confused and then a little scared that I’ve lost time.  I never remember what happened during the event.  It takes ~10-20 minutes to get back to normal.\n\nIf only one hippocampus is affected during an event, then everything seems like a dream.  I’m still confused, have limited function, but it’s not as scary (from my vantage point).  I recover more quickly from these.\n\nNow, after all these treatments, life is MUCH better.   I still have PNES, but my events are only a few minutes duration, and only affect one hippocampus at a time these days.  So, yeah, better.

All of that is an incredible amount of stress and trauma to have been through, and not knowing what's going on with symptoms like that--feeling down and depressed is about the only sane reaction.\n\nI do think you're on the right track with getting into see a psychiatrist and a neurologist. Starting meds to take the edge off of things will make it a bit easier to cope with everything, and seeing a neurologist can help you figure out exactly what's actually going on. Plus you're already seeing a therapist to help you work through the trauma, so it sounds to me like you're doing everything you should be doing.\n\nEven the best parents can drop the ball when it comes to medical care for chronic conditions for their kids. There's a lot of reasons why, but it sounds like you've got a good idea of what your mom's motivations were.

Sometimes talking about trauma or whatever triggers the events is too much for someone to work through, so medication works for them. Generally mediation is a last resort, because of what PNES is. I think CBT is the stepping stone. If someone finds CBT does not work for them, they should seek out other types of therapy, that might help them. Any form of therapy works, really. The nature of CBT is really to teach you tools to use when trauma comes up, how to deal with trauma, stress, anxiety, etc., and reduce PNES events.

This happens with other people, too, so I don't know. I think the pushiness can be really bad, especially for people who don't know much about mental health, therapy, and/or PNES and are getting a diagnosis for the first time, since they won't know what else to do if CBT ends up not working for them.

From what I've seen here, a solid support structure is pretty damn rare.

She never once thought I was faking it, even when I began to question it, standing by me the entire time.\n\nI've been dealing with my condition for a long time, and since it built up slowly, I've had time to adjust. I go most days without a major seizure, but have 2-4 minor seizures most days. I can still work for now, since I'm primarily a desk jockey, but I've spent more than my allotted off days, which is causing issues (managements fine, but union rules are killing me).

I feel like it will be an autobiography if I’m not careful..\n\nI feel so useless and dependent.. right when I finally got over some driving trauma my parents put me through.. enough to actually get a license.. seizures… I had just bought a car the previous year.\n\nI became a mom a few months before the seizures started.. PPD was so.. hard. Got put on S watch 3 times.. \n\nAll of my plans for myself and her, and any I try to make bow are like distant dreams..\n\nI can’t do much or tolerate much in my environment now, and with a toddler that’s hell. She’s actively crying right now because she doesn’t want to nap. It feels like daggers, and it’s radiating down into my core.. her pants of frustration build my anxiety.. I’ve had 6 seizures this morning while trying to play with her.\n\nLast night I had them while I was trying to make pasta. Started feeling it while standing over boiling water.. I’m lucky that I don’t have many spontaneous movements, little jerks but mostly my eyes..\n\nI’ve lost happy memories, I’ve lost important one.. I can’t remember to do chores well… looking at government paperwork asking stuff about me seems like looking at a midterm test in college… I don’t know if I could handle concerts or rollercoasters.. rock wall climbing.. all things I love.. \n\nI look in the fridge at leftovers someone put away without any labels and I can’t remember what it was of how old it is so some days I don’t eat because I don’t know what’s safe..\n\nWhat chores I remember I can usually only get half way through.. \n\nMy daughter who isn’t even 2 knows when I have episodes and hugs me, pulls me to her chest or the floor and pets/kisses my head.. it’s so sweet but she shouldn’t have to do that. That’s my job.. \n\nI worry about CPS taking her because I sometimes can’t do enough, and her dad works a lot.. I worry that maybe I shouldn’t be her mom.. that I can’t do enough for her..\n\nI spend hours a week trying to reframe my view of it, or find some new scientific breakthrough, like how we all have a low NPY count and the vegan diet can help elevate that.. but no one else wants to make the jump and it’s dangerous for me to cook sometimes.. \n\nI’ve tried to get someone to take me to the government offices to get assistance and insurance since their system doesn’t think I exist for almost a year. It’s 3 hours away if I walk, and we don’t have buses or cabs. 37 minutes if I was an experienced biker who actually owned a bike, but I never took to it as a kid. I need to see a dentist, even sensidine (spelling??) hurts now.\n\nI don’t have my own money so I have to ask for everything. So I can’t even get a bike to learn how to do it to travel places.. \n\nI want to get away from the in-laws but we can’t afford anywhere to live so we’re staying with them, and my skills and capabilities don’t apply to 98% of at home jobs, the other 2% I can’t do while taking care of a toddler who we also can’t afford to put in daycare. \n\nUghh sometimes I just want my existence to fade away already… then I remember my kid.. and then I don’t know what to feel..",1630085400,t3_pcd6sl,/r/PNESsupport/comments/pcd6sl/how_has_pnes_effected_you/hakxyg7/
hbrgzx0,pcd6sl,"I'm just so happy I found this group by randomly thinking to type it in because I've had this condition for 10 years and never been able to talk to anyone about it outside of the doctor who diagnosed it.  Vent incoming. \n\nIt was so terrible the first two-three years that I developed it that I was homebound, could not rely fully on myself to do basic things like stand, shower, make food, etc every time I needed because I was having several hour long bouts of catatonia and seizures every day, and I was dissociated 24/7.  It just felt like hell and I was very close to attempting suicide once.  I have PTSD and also unfortunately developed a new load of PTSD about PNES itself due to events that happened around the time my PNES was developing.  I can't drive because of it, though I'm trying to find a workaround to this if at all possible.  Driving fear from PTSD triggers my muscle spasms in my arms, legs, and neck which made it to extremely stressful and scary to fight while driving when I was learning.  I also have extreme difficulty judging distances/depth perception and I was diagnosed with light triggers during sensory tests (I can't remember what these were called but they were fucking awful) and doc heavily advised me not to drive.  I feel lost and don't really know where to go from there to begin attempting driving again but I want to try.  I hate feeling so trapped and limited, especially having a childhood of isolation confined to my bed from other chronic illnesses.  No one understands me when I explain my condition and just belittles it to I'm 'just afraid of driving' so I don't even explain my condition anymore, I use something else to explain why I don't drive.  I've lived in cities in other countries just to remedy not being able to drive and being from suburban America, and also in a city with horrendous road infrastructure. \n\nMore recently I've just entered a very stressful big change point in life with financial and home uncertainty after ending a toxic relationship and I've been so focused on the work in front of me and pushing back seizures or breaking down that I'm starting to have consistent big muscle twitches throughout the day that it's starting to interfere with daily life again.  I'm afraid of breaking things in the kitchen or hitting my arm on something.  I'm always scared someone will see me twitching due to said PTSD around PNES which only makes me twitch more, and big giant twitches, any time I have to see or interact with someone.  After the first five years of the condition I had used my own found techniques to treat and prevent seizures that I was down to just having a few 15 min seizures per year, and now they're coming back.  I just hate it.  \n\nI don't like feeling sorry for myself because it accomplishes nothing, so I'm always reminding myself how much worse things could be and being grateful for the good things I do have.  But it feels really good to vent it out, especially in a place where other people understand.

hbx0se4,pcd6sl,"I've been having them for about 10 years (maybe more) and while they don't happen very often, the only thing that's gotten easier is recognizing the start of one and knowing what to do at that time.

Sometimes it's a panic attack instead, sometimes it's nothing. \n\nKnowing her anxiety triggers would be a big part of how she can improve her level of function. My most persistent trigger is sound. So my solution is to carry earplugs or ear defenders with me everywhere. \n\nAs far as chest tightness, breathing exercises really help me, and laying with a weighted blanket. An on the fly alternative I've found is a yoga pose called Anjali Mudra, which is just pressing your palms together in front of your chest. I like to do it REALLY HARD, because when I release the pose, the pressure relief feels amazing. Having a little break to do Anjali Mudra and some breathing exercises is a big help for me if I feel like I'm approaching Crisis Mode.",1629228976,t3_p61k5x,/r/PNESsupport/comments/p61k5x/question_about_anxiety_and_seizures/h9bp5ww/
h9caqmw,p61k5x,"anxiety is definitely one of my triggers, but i instead feel a weird sensation in my back that happens before a seizure. thankfully i've learned how to keep myself from having a seizure; almost talking myself out of it. my PNES has almost become a person, so i often talk out loud saying stuff like ""go away/no no no no/stop it/etc"". i've personally found it to be very helpful. although there are times when i know i'm going to have a seizure that day eventually based on how many times i have to fend of a seizure. i try to avoid my stress/anxiety triggers by not seeking out news stories because i know they'll upset me.",1629238127,t3_p61k5x,/r/PNESsupport/comments/p61k5x/question_about_anxiety_and_seizures/h9caqmw/

h9dr5un,p61k5x,"Yes, absolutely. It's like a pressure cooker for me, building up inside. No matter what I can't see to stop it, although relaxation techniques do slow it down.

h9e0rwo,p61k5x,Yes and Yes. Thank you for asking. I've been living with my version of PNES for over 20 years. I hope I can give others some hope about this fascinating yet debilitating condition of the brain.\n\nMy story is simple: suffered a long bout of depression which eventually subsided and changed into PNES. I went for almost 2 decades without a decent diagnosis. I did therapy (CBT) for two years which helped me immensely. My seizures have gone down from 50-100 per year to about 5-10. I'm on no medications at the moment.,1629276391,t1_h9drvw0,/r/PNESsupport/comments/p61k5x/question_about_anxiety_and_seizures/h9e0rwo/

h9emczf,p61k5x,"Yes, dealing with stressors and techniques that help identify what my mind is really feeling.\n\nA key for me was my depression. It was so long and deep that the sadness was pushes down into a deeper part of my brain (my theory). It's now difficult for me to tell when I'm stressed or anxious. My mind tallies up the amount of stress that I'm unable to perceive and explodes in a seizure when it reaches a certain threshold. Therapy helped me identify stress in my body and helped me slow down. I still have seizures but then again that's life and that's ok too.\n\nI now am much kinder to myself than before, much less of a perfectionist and I listen a lot more to my body. Be kind to yourself is basically the gist of it. Sincerely hope this helps! Good luck",1629292632,t1_h9eevtd,/r/PNESsupport/comments/p61k5x/question_about_anxiety_and_seizures/h9emczf/

h8q6r9z,p3bcoc,"Well, I mean, I'd got with whatever treatment they recommend for the physical cause and keep up the rest since it's helping. It may be a combination of the two. Stress can exacerbate pretty much every physical ailment and honestly seizures in and of themselves are pretty traumatic plus like...

h8rtw4m,p3bcoc,">That said, while it sucks that there actually is something wrong, I personally would find that very validating.\n\nIt is kinda validating, but then I feel bad for feeling validated. Any illness or disorder is worthy of attention and empathy- not just those with physical causes. It is nice to know that I'll be (hopefully) taken more seriously now, and it's easier to explain ""yeah brain didn't develop right"" than trying to explain my whole tragic backstory that led to FND to others.\n\nI'm definitely gonna keep up with treatment- I'm concerned though that me doing the treatment is just masking epilepsy, and epileptic seizures can cause further brain damage. \n\nI'm waiting for a followup with my neuro and have an EEG scheduled now so I guess we'll see what comes of that.\n\nI hope life is good to you!",1628854744,t1_h8q6r9z,/r/PNESsupport/comments/p3bcoc/anyone_here_with_pnes_and_heterotopia/h8rtw4m/
h8rtzwg,p3bcoc,Wild.
