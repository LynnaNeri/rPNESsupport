Sometimes I drool, I am concious but not able to talk during a pseudo seizure. \n\nThe only way to know for sure if your chronic pain is causing PNES is to talk to a Neurologist to rule out the epilepsy for sure and then see a psychologist for them to diagnose you. \n\nI was diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder and Conversion Disorder.

ew870aq,cmrp0c,"I can only go on personal experience when it comes to what I’ve found what helps though you might find a lot of this stuff familiar as you have chronic pain. There is no cure but it can be managed.\n\n1. a lot of doctors don’t like calling them seizures (which often has the connotation of epilepsy), so they often call them “attacks” or “episodes” until it’s diagnosed. I got very upset with this because it felt like I wasn’t being taken seriously when In fact it’s just that PNES is something that is easily misdiagnosed and as such a large amount of doctors don’t know how to deal with it. They are swimming in uncharted waters, so let them know your worries but try to keep your calm. (I was fired from a doctor for yelling at them, seriously, keep your calm).\n\n2: keep a journal. Write down what you were doing right before they happened, your sleep patterns, eating habits (bullet journals are my friend). This can be shown to your doctors which will help them out a lot.\n\n3: do not skip meds, meals or liquids. Like at all. This can affect you more than you realize. Small meals more often (something to talk to your doctor about) and drink when you’re thirsty (for me that’s all the time).\n\n4: self care is important. Take breaks, if you need to sit down, sit down. Do not let yourself get run down if you can. [how to deal with chronic pain #buildingtheladder](https://youtu.be/f3uF3EpSZMw)  This video is about chronic pain but i found a lot of good tips for depression and days when my PNES is just kicking my ass.\n\n5: counselling for your GAD can give you coping skills. W.R.A.P was a program I went through for helping with stress your doctor might have something similar group support can do wonders.",1565204570,t1_ew81cdi,/r/PNESsupport/comments/cmrp0c/can_anyone_shed_some_light_on_my_situation/ew870aq/

Sounds similar to the always be neutral and calm emotional restrictions I already have, I take pregabalin which keeps me calm which is an anti epileptic drug, so can’t be epilepsy even more so. I’m also currently in counselling for depression and poor mood due to bad pain which is good! I’ll bring it up with them too.

It converts the stress into physical disorders. \n\nI have combat the people who believe “it’s all in my head” with, “it’s similar to PTSD.”  This gets them to stop and think. It’s especially hard for older generations like our parents and grandparents to understand what is going on with our minds and bodies.\n\nI’m sorry your therapist is away on holiday but if you need to talk to someone in the meantime you can take a look into possible walk in councillors who help are there just to listen to people who need a single session.
