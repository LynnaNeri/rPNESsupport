ukhby8,1651942142,Newport Institute?,Anyone heard of/gone to/ know someone who's gone to Newport Institute? I'm in talks with them of going this summer to their Minnesota location for a while. I want to go somewhere to begin the psychological side of the treatment. The only bad reviews I can find are people who just didn't like their methods or didn't realise how expensive it was before going. I'm lucky enough that my insurance will cover the majority of it but I just don't want to get there and be worse off mentally bc it's a poor facility.,https://www.reddit.com/r/PNESsupport/comments/ukhby8/newport_institute/

uhq50f,1651612341,Therapist claims I will be problem free in three months,"Disclaimer: This is just a bit of a rant about what I’m going through rn. My parents pay for my medical treatment so who I see (aside from my free resources I get through my university) is out of my control. If I had a choice I would switch therapists as I know that’s really the best solution here but I can’t do that so I’m just venting cuz I need some more support rn. \n\n\n\nSo my parents have been trying to argue with me for about five months as to how much support I really need for my mental health issues and PNES. They don’t like that I consider myself disabled. They don’t want me to get a service dog or school accommodations (even though all of it is suggested and supported by my psychologist and psychiatrist). This has caused my stepmom to believe that I need to see a new therapist cuz my school one apparently isn’t good enough cuz I’m not making progress fast enough. \n\n\nThe therapist she picked out is so so strange. She keeps insisting that I’ll be fine after three months of therapy with her and that my CPTSD, anxiety, and PNES are all easily fixable. She also had me draw pictures for a whole session and then interpreted them as indicative of my mental state? Its all just weirding me out and I know as soon as I’m not “cured” in three months my parents will use that as evidence I’m not trying.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PNESsupport/comments/uhq50f/therapist_claims_i_will_be_problem_free_in_three/

u8zc7s,1650580146,"Hi everyone, not officially diagnosed but all my doctors(besides my neuro) believe I’m suffering from PNES. need advice, who do I go to for answers?","Hi everyone!!\n\nIf you’d like more context ur more than welcome to peruse my past posts in the CPTSD subreddit. But basically I’ve been experiencing “fainting spells” since about age 12. Once I turned 18 and began living on my own they increased significantly. The past two years I’ve been fainting every month or every over month, until March. No medical explanation besides “it’s probably syncope”. I fainted once when in the Psych ward and everyone thought I had a seizure, then afterward they told me I just fainted. I didn’t explain how often I was fainting, but at that time I didn’t understand how serious my childhood trauma was or that it could even be connected to my mental health. \n\nI finally got diagnosed CPTSD, major depressive disorder, GAD and OCD(from childhood) this past March following a really bad bout of depression brought on by a big fight with my mother that resulted in us halting communication for a couple of months. And I had my first “tremor episode” (what I’ve been calling them because no one knows what exactly it is yet). The feeling I have prior to the shaking is very similar to how I feel before fainting. \n\nBasically I’ll usually feel “out of it”, weird body sensations usually on my left side, my vision will start to get “static-ey” and tunnel like, hearing becomes hypersensitive, heart rate rises, blood pressure feels like it drops. Some times I’ll slur words if I try to say something. And then I’ll start jerking really intensely, my hips and legs mostly. If my arms are affected I’ll drop whatever it is I’m holding. But my latest episode I was like punching the bed, clapping, punching myself, tapping my head. Doing really weird but specific movements. At one point i was snapping my fingers lmao. I can’t even snap normally lol. My arms were twisting and my feet were turning inward. They usually last 20-30mins, but the last episode lasted well over an hour. Since these episodes started in March, I haven’t been losing consciousness. Sometimes I’ll disassociate but I fight to stay conscious so I can pay attention to what my body is feeling. \n\nMy neuro said they sound stress/anxiety induced and said I can do an eeg and mri to help ease my anxiety. Am I crazy for thinking she should be more concerned? Shouldn’t we be ruling out epilepsy so I can get closer to figuring out the actual cause? My therapist (in my group for PTSD) said she sees this pretty often with PTSD patients, and calls them pseudo seizures. I just want an answer because every time this happens to me it’s really really frightening. I’m so confused, what doctor should I be seeing? My neuro seems very dismissive and it’s scaring me tbh. I’m going through with the EEG and MRI regardless, as recommended by my psychiatrist. Even my psychiatrist thought my neuro was being dismissive.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PNESsupport/comments/u8zc7s/hi_everyone_not_officially_diagnosed_but_all_my/
u7i3fi,1650409470,Does anyone else feel like they can't live alone anymore? Also do theses sound like PNES seizures or should I look for answers elsewhere? [rant and a /lot/ questions],"Full disclosure, I'm in the process of getting tested and diagnosed with something. I have a very high suspicion that it is PNES because the EEG came back normal. But honestly if it's not I don't care I just want it treated. Reason I come here for support is because I've been told a lot of the symptoms are similar if not the symptoms to PNES. \n\nFor the first question, over the past two years my symptoms have worsen. I twitch, I spaz, and I freeze. It's gotten to a point that it makes me feel like I can't be left alone or drive long distances or do anything by myself. Just this morning I collapsed in the shower, not able to put weight onto anything or talk for like 30 mins at least. I don't mind being around people but I like my independence. Also after every episode my brain feels fuzzy so there is only so many people I can stand to be around in that state. To make matters worse I broke up with my significant other/best friend recently. They're going through their own mental health crisis and don't ever want to leave the house or see people. And I'm totally empathetic just with everything else going on in my life it makes me feel like I lost the person I trusted to take care of me if things go south and can stand in any kind of mental state. I feel like I won't be able to live alone anymore. Like I need a nurse but I'm only in my early 20s. Did anyone else feel like they couldn't live alone? If you do live alone how to do you cope? Do you have like a life alert system or something if you have a seizure in a severely inopportune place? Does anyone feel like they are a strain on the people that they trust to help when it gets bad? Or do you find it better to deal with it yourself than lean on people when it gets bad?\n\nFor my second inquiry, I know y'all aren't doctors but I'm mainly looking similarities or differences between my condition and the people in this community. Does anyone freeze for seizures? Or maybe tick like you have Tourettes? Or even able to suppress the symptoms even if takes a lot of energy? Anyone here have PNES and Tourettes? I'm transgender as well so if anyone has taken testosterone here did it negatively affect your condition? Does anyone vocalize when seizing (like a whistle, a click, or a random Link from Zelda type noise)? Anyone else get the fuzzy feeling in their head after an episode? I know it's a lot of questions and I don't expect an answer to all of them.

While this shift in functional organization may confer a short-term adaptive advantage—one that facilitates neural communication and the child’s capacity to respond self-protectively in the face of stressful life events—it may also have a significant biological cost. It may predispose the child’s neural networks to periods of instability—presenting clinically as PNES—when the neural networks are faced with perturbations in energy flow or with additional demands.""\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, very interested to see the results of this study:\n\n[Neurobiology of Functional Movement Disorder and Non-Epileptic Seizures](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00500994)\n\nResearchers are conducting tests to see if two genes that are normally found in healthy individuals are found more frequently in patients with uncontrolled shaking",https://www.reddit.com/r/PNESsupport/comments/tw63hy/know_of_any_interesting_new_research_on_pnes/

It is my greatest hobby, the thing I love to do most in the entire world. \n\nAfter I got operated on I became about 70% blind (the damaged part of my brain, taken out, managed my eyesight). After picking up rowing again and painstakingly getting up in the higher divisions (most coaches saw a blind guy as too big of a risk to select in the higher performing crews) I got approached with the question if I wanted to participate in the selections of my country’s Paralympic team. I did, got through. \n\nBecause of some rules we wouldn’t be participating in this year’s season, so I decided to row a season with one my friends in a 2x (double sculls, aka two oars each, no coxswain).

touci4,1648310237,Does this sound like PNES? I’m waiting for a neurology appt,"I (23F)was recently diagnosed PTSD, major depressive, generalized anxiety, and I was diagnosed OCD as a child but we think this may have been a misdiagnosis as I only have tendencies now. I’m waiting for my neurology appt as my psychiatrist suspects PNES, due to my long term trauma/abuse from childhood. \n\nI’ll start by saying I’ve been fainting all my life and didn’t think much of it. I’D been to the ER as a kid and wore a heart monitor. It came back that my heart wasn’t the issue, but the doc said it seemed ok. I continued to faint occasionally (like once or twice a year, followed by convulsions. Before hand I would be lightheaded and start slurring.) and apparently was convulsing as well, although my parents never told me the convulsing occurred. I thought I was just lying still while unconscious. \n\nFlash forward to the future where I’m an adult. The fainting spells become much more frequent. About two years ago, around age 21 they become very frequent. Sometimes twice a month or once a month. And if I don’t hit the ground I still experience light headedness. I also experience issues with focus/memory loss, but never thought the two may be connected. I kinda figured I might have something else or I just need to work through my trauma and maybe I will be able to focus on things. \n\nI once woke in the middle of the night feeling ill. Went to use the restroom and fainted, hit my head and loss consciousness. This one was a red flag bc my body woke me just to faint. \n\nNow a couple years later (age 23) I’ve been to the ER twice this past month because I’ve started experiencing these “episodes”. \n\nTo start I felt some weird body sensations, and then I felt my heart constrict. After that I tried to say something to my sister, to let her know I wasn’t feeling well and was probably going to pass out. My words came out like gibberish. Then a few seconds later I started having muscle spasms. My back was arching a bit and my legs were kicking. My jaw clenched shut as well. My arms were also shaking. I was fully conscious through the whole thing, and this was the first time thats ever happened to me. It lasted about 20 minutes. When I went to the ER they just gave me Ativan and said I needed to see a neurologist. Same thing happened the next day as well, and pretty much for the week after. The week after that it stopped, and then this week, it started up again. \n\nI got up, felt dizzy/odd sensations. My hearing became hypersensitive. And the wrongs words came out when I tried to form a sentence. Then I started convulsing again while fully conscious. I Can feel all my muscles contracting and it’s so odd. \n\nI’m not looking for a diagnosis, I’ll wait for my neurology appt for that. Just wondering if anyone has experienced similiar?

The episodes were very disruptive and were negatively affecting my mental health including mood, socialization, and concentration.\n\nTwo months after the frequent episodes started last year, I decided to see a neurologist who gave me an MRI and EEG. Both tests came back as normal. I got a second opinion from another neurologist who thought it might be that I have juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). I was given lamotrigine for a few months but it didn’t seem to help much other than possibly shorten the frequency of the seizures.\n\nI then saw another neurologist who specializes in epilepsy and she is not sure if I even have epilepsy to begin with. She thinks I could have psychogenic seizures and/or epilepsy. She is doubting the JME diagnosis but has not been able to rule out another form of epilepsy. She switched my medication from lamotrigine to briviact. Since starting brivact, my episodes involving shaking rarely come and I find my condition(s) less disruptive which likely suggests that I do have epilepsy as I appear to be responding better to briviact (although I am not sure if this is a placebo effect or not). But I still have several non-shaking episodes each day that affect my memory, mood, and concentration. These happen up to around 20-30 times per day for up to six seconds. They seem to be triggered by stress and anxiety. I am wondering if my epileptic seizures are better because they are being treated with medication but I think I could be having psychogenic seizures that have been untreated.\n\nThe seizures that remain involve me holding my breath, losing concentration, getting stiff in my upper body and neck, and often making a strange uncontrolled arm movement where my hand reaches and grabs the back of my neck or collarbone.\n\nMy hunch is that I have both epileptic and non-epilpetic psychogenic seizures which would explain why my condition has improved a bit since starting an anti-epilpetic medication but why my non-shaking episodes have not improved. I wonder if my last psychedelic trip changed something in my brain? Perhaps it could have released some past trauma that has not been resolved and has caused my body to react in the form of psychogenic seizures?\n\nDo you think I could have epilepsy, psychogenic nonepileptic seizures, both, or something else? What treatment options should I consider?",https://www.reddit.com/r/PNESsupport/comments/stb93e/frequent_convulsions/

qedzgl,1635024593,I was always told these were panic attacks and it never seemed right. Is this what PNES is like for you guys too?,"I just discovered PNES and I think it finally answers these experiences I've been wondering about for years.  Can you guys tell me if this sounds like something you relate to? \n\nI've always wondered about is this response I seem to have when I get to this point of overwhelm and my brain ""breaks"".  It's always been triggered during periods of prolonged stress and extreme guilt in unhealthy relationships, and will get triggered by something seemingly minor at the time.  I have been told it's some kind of panic attack by docs, nurses, a therapist but I never have felt like that actually fits at all.  It seems like the opposite of a panic attack to me- it feels like my heart and breathing all slow and I just become still and I escape everything for a while and dissociate from everything and everyone fully.  It kind of builds up slowly or suddenly into this period where I can't move at all or feel anything, can last for an hour or many and it takes me a few days to recover after.  I go into a trance and stare blankly at nothing and can barely communicate- usually just very basic things in a strange, monotone voice that isn't me and is apparently super creepy.  I would swear I don't even blink for hours but I don't actually know if that's possible (?) I feel paralyzed and small and don't know what to do with myself and i'm extremely calm at the same time.  I can never tell if I'm afraid to move, unwilling to move, or if I physically can't move.  It's almost a welcome relief because all my emotions and thoughts just stop completely, but it can be objectively scary, especially the first time it happened.  It's only happened about 4 times over the last 4 or so years, and I've learned that guilt and shame are my biggest triggers. \n\nThe very first time it happened I had a sensation before it started where I suddenly felt physically high and light-headed and like the room was moving, like when you smoke too much weed, although I hadn't done any.  (i'm not into weed or any non-medical drug use for myself).  Knowing I hadn't done drugs and shouldn't randomly feel high, I freaked out and I was convinced my brain was bleeding or I had eaten something poisoned and was about to die and I started freaking out at my parents to call an ambulance.  Then within a couple minutes I sat and went into that frozen, calm state that I described earlier, afraid to move because I still thought I was dying and waited for them to come.  When the paramedics came they said they didn't know what it was but it didn't seem like panic attacks they usually respond to and whatever body stats they measured were abnormal.  They took me to the hospital, I was frozen in my position and they had to lift me and wheel me in.  I was frozen at the hospital for hours and then they gave me drugs to relax me and did brain scans and tests and didn't find any issues so they sent me home with some antidepressants and said it was probably a panic attack (which I've always been confused about).  The antidepressants actually work really well for me and I've been on and off the same ones ever since.  Whenever I've experienced this kind of shut down again I have always been on a break from those meds.  So luckily, I think they help me a lot and I'm glad I went to that hospital.  All other other times this happened it was less sudden and I recognized the feeling coming so I wasn't as scared and confused.  Usually it's more distressing to the person I am with at the time because it's concerning to witness, or they are someone who thinks I am faking and need to snap out of it (couple bad relationships).  I've never known how to explain it, and never understood it myself and only just today learned about these non-epileptic seizures.  It seems so much more accurate than panic attacks to me which I always felt wrong identifying it with.  I think I have even had some mild panic attacks before but they were sweaty, hyperventilating, panicky things that only lasted a few minutes.  Those also don't seem to happen when I am medicated.  I always think the PNES(?) experience I have seems like how some animals must feel when they are in imminent danger and they freeze and ""play dead"".\n\nIs this similar to any of what you guys experience? \n\nI'm also wondering if anyone else who experiences this relates to having a bad memory through their life.  I don't remember events from my past very well, good or bad.  I don't trust feelings I had from. Childhood to now and tend to think I've made stuff up because I can't remember details.  I feel really disconnected and hateful of my past self, even though it's not like I have done really bad things.  I'm finding it hard doing therapy and working through the roots of my issues when I genuinely don't remember or trust anything from before now, and I feel like it's not part of me at all.  \nI have been working hard on myself for a while and trying to reconnect all aspects of who I am and be understanding and I am making progress but the memory issue is a huge pain for me.  My mind just goes so weird and blank even with neutral and very simple things I should be able to recall.\n\nFor some reason all of this feels related.  I think I shut out parts of me and my feelings and memories really efficiently all the time, and when I go into this frozen state it feels like EVERYTHING shuts down at once. \n\nSorry that's so long!  I appreciate anyone sharing their experiences/input 💜",https://www.reddit.com/r/PNESsupport/comments/qedzgl/i_was_always_told_these_were_panic_attacks_and_it/

pknb59,1631149161,I’m feeling really down right now and need to vent,"Okay, so for about 3-4 years (started at 6 years old) of my childhood I’ve suffered from full Grand Mal seizures. Doctors and neurologists ran several tests and couldn’t figure out what was wrong with me. My mom thinks it was because my blood sugar was high… got tests for diabetes etc. and they all came back normal. \nFast forward to about high school, I started getting really bad anxiety and panic attacks. They started when I was sitting on my knees for too long and my legs fell asleep; this triggered a flashback to when I use to have grand mal’s (seizures started in legs), which then led me into a constant state of panic and anxiety. \nFrom then on, my nerves started twitching a lot, I got bad headaches, and weird shock-like feelings in my head whenever I got really anxious/stressed. At this time, my mom didn’t really care too much to see what was wrong, so I ended up just dealing with these things until I was too distracted to notice and until they went away.\nNow, I am in college. This year was very tough for me emotionally: I became suicidal, depressed, and I started self-harming. Now, I’ve been in therapy for almost 8 months, so I’ve dealt with these problems. I’ve noticed, though when I get very anxious and start dissociating, I start twitching bad, getting shock feeling in head, headaches, weird feeling behind eyes, or I freeze and zone out completely to the point where I can’t even talk. \nI’ve done to the doctors office last week, all my tests came back normal, no diabetes. I’ve mentioned my headaches to my therapist and she things they’re caused by anxiety. So, she referred me to a psychiatrist to get anxiety medication, along with that , I also have a neurologist appointment coming up. For so long I thought seizures were just grand mal, but now I’m worried that I’m having focal or absent seizures without knowing. \nThis even led me to question my mom and why she’s neglected this for so long during my childhood. My doctor prescribed me keppra and I was taking it for about 3 years, but then my mom refused to refill my prescription and even tried to outsmart my doctors. So, they never figured the cause of my seizures. Now that I think about it, it was probably caused by stress (neglectful parents that worked a lot. One parent drug addict. I was sexually abused around the time of my seizures. I was also emotionally abused all throughout childhood).\n\n\nI know this is very long, but I am so lost right now. I can’t stop ruminating on my awful childhood.

pisidz,1630903507,How do your partners cope &amp; support you?,"Hi, I'm new to finding this sub but was diagnosed with PNES 10 years ago, don't have epilepsy or anything else neuro-related apart from a generalized sleep disorder.  \n\nBecause of how my life was when I developed this, I was terrified of my partner seeing me have a seizure and always dreaded having 'the talk' of trying to explain it to them, and trying to gauge when the best time in a relationship is to tell them.  My seizures are since much more controlled and milder but i'm still capable of having pretty bad seizures.  If I'm not having mild muscle jerking or a 'light' 15-30min seizure, then my seizures are at least 2 hours long with extreme catatonia and dissociation which completely locks the speech part of my brain.  Because of this, I am always really worried I'll have a bad seizure like this from triggers I can't always avoid in everyday-life, or new triggers I'm not expecting, and feel that it's best I inform my partner that I am diagnosed, these seizures happen, sometimes I can't talk, and they are not life threatening and please do not panic or call an ambulance.  I also just generally dread telling people because I feel like I can watch the expression in their face as their opinion of me goes from ""cool normal person"" to, ""oh, you're one of 'those' people"" and I really hate that feeling.  It feels like a lightbulb switches on in their head like ""aha, I found what's wrong with you.""  I don't feel like it's right for someone to perceive me as 'disabled' or 'special needs' because unless it's really bad, which is very uncommon now, I function just like everyone else, I just have a few situational triggers I avoid and that's it.  But honestly I don't know if I do or do not qualify for those labels. \n\nAnd as far as support goes in my experience, some partners would literally forget I have PNES after me explaining it and having mild seizures in front of them multiple times, others would offer to 'hug' me in that kind of body hold that helps create resistance for the muscle movements and calm them down. \n\n\nSo **TLDR:**  How do you explain your PNES to new people you date?  When do you decide to tell them?  What kind of reactions have you gotten?  Do your partners do anything special to help you during a seizure or symptoms?  Do they remember your triggers and proactively help you?  Do you have any special routines around your PNES?",https://www.reddit.com/r/PNESsupport/comments/pisidz/how_do_your_partners_cope_support_you/
pipejy,1630890811,My experience with CBT,"Hello friends. I’ve been feeling down but I wanted to share my experience with CBT. \n\nSo I am going to therapy for my anxiety and trauma. It was recommended for me so I can understand myself better. I started CBT last year in September or November. I didn’t have the greatest experience because I thought it was ineffective. I was not receiving any response to how I was feeling or response. I wanted to see a specialist that understood PNES. After some time, I started to search for another therapist. Someone that can better communicate what I’m experiencing and I can receive feedback no matter how positive or negative. \n\n\nSo I did. I got a therapist that challenges me and makes me think of how I perceive my trauma. I’m learning a lot about myself. I’m extremely sensitive and the reason I’m always tired is because I’m really sad. I have a lot pressure from my family and school. My background is the biggest challenge/barrier. I’m learning some people do have it easier than me and that’s okay. I’m okay with that because by now I know I’m not neglecting my mental wellness anymore.

phb6wq,1630694536,Why do doctors only suggest CBT?,"It's honestly bothering me. My neurologists (last one moved) both told me the ONLY way to treat PNES is with CBT and when I told them that I had already tried CBT four times with four different therapists and ended up more traumatized than before, they just... gave up? They acted like that was the end of the line for treatment and my latest neurologist, while usually great, implied that I didn't want to try to get better if I didn't want to traumatize myself with CBT again? And the first neurologist was fine with me saying I wanted to do EMDR but the latest one wasn't? And this seems to be a theme among doctors when it comes to anything psychological.\n\nNothing against the people CBT does help. I realize it's a useful tool for a lot of people. I'm just confused as to why they don't mention alternatives and why they are acting like CBT is the end all be all of treatment and therapy when there are so many other types of therapies that might be more effective depending on the individual, especially when the disorder is caused by something as personal and individual as trauma.

I’m exhausted!",https://www.reddit.com/r/PNESsupport/comments/pa7pbh/pnes_epilepsy/
p7sgsg,1629423700,Thoughts?,"Hello friends,\n\nI completed a 2 day EEG after I was told it would be 5-7 days.  They confirmed my diagnosis for the second time.\n\nRant: I thought it was pointless being there because I don’t feel like they told me anything new. I was disappointed because I already knew most of they they told me. No actual explanation for my strange symptoms :/ \n\nThe doctor I saw said there’s no damage to the brain. I was told that the brain is not responding very well. The brain should be trained or taught how to react again. \n\nWhat do you guys think? Do you think it could be that (whatever caused PNES to develop) is miscommunication? \n\nIs it possible our brain manifested these symptoms to suppress what we have been through? From my research, it seems like PTSD is a major theme or experience any sort of anxiety, fear, and traumatic experience. \n\n\nIs the solution to relearn how we react? Maybe we have to avoid some parts. To build ourselves to a high potential issue in order to fight off these “triggers” \n\nWhat if our brain is tricking us? Because it’s exhausted?",https://www.reddit.com/r/PNESsupport/comments/p7sgsg/thoughts/
p61k5x,1629198283,Question about anxiety and seizures,"A friend of mine has been having seizures for many years but apparently no epilepsy. The way she explains it is that sometimes she will feel a very strong anxiety and a lump in her chest, and the anxiety keeps building up until she has a seizure to release that ""pressure"".\n\nI'm wondering if others can relate to this sensation and if there are ways to handle these without needing to have a seizure to get rid of her anxiety.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PNESsupport/comments/p61k5x/question_about_anxiety_and_seizures/
p4hc9i,1628979404,does this seem like pnes??,"i (17F) had a seizure-like episode last week. \n\ni was getting ready to go to an appointment and i started feeling sick. i was really nauseous and felt super weak and out of it. i drank some water hoping it would help and got into the car with my mom. i felt awful, i put the seat back hoping i could rest and that the awful feeling would go away. i told my mom i felt sick and that talking was too draining. we pull out of the driveway, and i start to feel worse, the last thing i remember is everything shrinking. my vision changed, i got funnel vision. i felt like i was disappearing. the next thing i remember is feeling like i was in a dream, it was terrifying and i couldn’t wake up. it felt like it had been hours. i was conscious kind of, i had no idea what was going on, everything felt dark and i couldn’t open my eyes or control my body. slowly reality comes back, i can hear my mom saying my name. i start to see normally, and after about a minute of feeling totally out of it i regain full awareness and control of my senses. i go to the hospital and they tell me they don’t think it was an epileptic seizure, and mention the possibility of pnes. i got an eeg, but haven’t gotten the results. i read somewhere that people experiencing pnes episodes remain conscious the entire time, but i definitely blacked out at one point. \n\ndoes my experience seem like it could be pnes? i know everyone is different but i would love some insight into what other people’s experiences are, to see if they feel relatable.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PNESsupport/comments/p4hc9i/does_this_seem_like_pnes/
p3bcoc,1628810269,Anyone here with PNES and Heterotopia?,"Hi everyone!\n\nSo I just had an MRI to confirm the diagnosis my neuro was almost certain of- Functional Neurological Disorder- only for the MRI to reveal dead tissue (likely unrelated to my seizures from what I understand but still concerning) and also revealing grey matter heterotopia- which tends to cause my exact symptoms (focal seizures, poor motor control) and also tends to show symptoms in the second decade of life. Somehow, I fit both of these diagnoses perfectly.\n\nSo now I'm confused. I've been doing treatments recommended for FND/PNES (limit stress, ID triggers, cut off all substances) and have seen great improvements- I've even started taking SSRIs and going to more intense therapy. I've seen improvements- I went from daily seizures to weeks without seizures with the occasional breakthrough seizure but that was always during times of stress. Now it turns out my seizures may have a physical cause... so what do I do now?\n\nI know you can have epilepsy and FND at the same time, but I guess I'm just so shocked that there's a physical cause that I'm hoping someone else can relate?\n\nI hope y'all have a good day. Take care of yourselves.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PNESsupport/comments/p3bcoc/anyone_here_with_pnes_and_heterotopia/
