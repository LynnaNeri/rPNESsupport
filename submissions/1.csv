mvzg0x,1619075850,First seizures (2 within 10 hours),"So Saturday night was the scariest moments of my fianc√©es life and my life as well, when she had her first seizure. She has anxiety and some other mental health diagnoses, but the anxiety has been triggering a lot more often lately after we moved to a different state and her health insurance has changed and could no longer see her therapist that she loved. This has caused her to not be able to have the CBT that she needs to keep her anxiety at bay. It has slowly been getting worse over about a year resulting in more frequent panic attacks. They are usually manageable and I‚Äôve developed some of my own remedies that have helped her through them. Saturday was one of the best days we‚Äôve had in a while and had an even better night together. Not a single time did anxiety arise and we were about to go to sleep when she said she starting to feel anxious and felt some tingling in her fingers which is uncommon, but happens time to time. I sat down next to her and the tingling spread up her arms then everywhere. That turn into numbness which has never happened then turned to can‚Äôt move limbs and quickly sent her into panic and it went from can‚Äôt move her leg, then arm and then she said she felt like she was going to pass out and her vision doubled or blurred, and then she stopped talking and moving completely while still conscious looking at me and her hands looked like they cramped as lobster claws and she tried to speak and it was slurred/mumbled and when I looked at her mouth I thought she was having a stroke. Her cheeks had a drooping look to them and hearing a mumble while I saw that, I jumped up and yelled she was having a stroke and went to pick her up to rush to the ER. She then mumbled a little clearer this time as I was lifting her, it‚Äôs a panic attack and this has happen before. I put her down and analyzed her face and again said you‚Äôre having a stroke, move your face and mouth, which she then could. She started slowly regaining mobility and was drenched from head to toe and I knew this was no panic attack. Over the next 4 -6 hours she had constant tremors, aggressive &amp; jerky limb thrashes mixed with head and eye movements that I knew were forms of seizures. They lessened as time went on and she eventually fell asleep, only to be woken by violent limb movements and screaming. Eventually lessened to a point that she could sleep. I watched her for another 6 hours without sleeping to make sure it didn‚Äôt happen again. The next day she felt terrible and we discussed everything that happened and I was convinced it was a mini stroke (TIA) followed by seizures. We decided she should go get checked out and immediately the tinge in her fingers came back. We quickly got ready and while I drove to the ER, it happened again, only this one didn‚Äôt paralyze her and she was more lethargic and had a slight slur or mumble but I could understand. I rushed her into a wheelchair and they quickly took her, pushed me out of the hospital because of Covid, and didn‚Äôt care much to hear what I saw and what happened. I called their line from outside and explained every detail to help them figure out what happened. About 6 hours later she was released after blood work and an EKG was done. They quickly chalked it up to a panic attack and low potassium. Which infuriated me beyond belief because my older brother growing up had twitching/tick seizures that most people would think aren‚Äôt seizures so I was sure of what those were. Her PCP today heard me out in detail from beginning to end and said it for sure was a seizure and probably combined with a panic attack and we are now about to Schedule an emergency visit to a neurologist to figure everything out. She explained different types of seizures and this one came up due to its correlation that I witnessed with the anxiety. I know this was very long, but we don‚Äôt know much about this stuff and I haven‚Äôt been able to sleep since it started (got 2 hours the last 2 nights), I‚Äôm just wondering if anyone has had any similarities between symptoms or if anyone has any advice or tips regarding important, possible life saving things to look for or do, and when to do them?

liyrcw,1613215086,a breakdown of my symptoms and medical history for anyone interested,"Just learned I might be suffering from PNES. I'm like 98% sure that is what is going on, but I'm just starting my research.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I was 16-17 I started getting very occasional ""tics"". it would usually start with my thoughts spinning out of control, accelerating and then culminating in my whole body shaking. It wasn't repeated shaking. Just one ""flash"". I remember telling my parents, who are usually very engaged and understanding and I remember feeling odd that they didn't seem to take it seriously at all. Like it was something commonplace I had described. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I moved out from home at 21 (to study) my life would quite quickly deteriorate. When I was 23 or 24 (I'm very bad at placing events in time with any sort of accuracy) I was hospitalized with a diagnosis of Schizophrenia Simplex. A diagnosis I have never felt was very accurate. Leading up till this point I had self-medicated with weed. I would get ""brain storms"" where my thoughts would spin out of control and I would get the ""tic"" but now it would repeat and repeat. When I was younger the ""tic"" would sorta ""shake me out of it"" but now it would just repeat. I guess it must have looked like a seizure. I'm 35 now and have been in almost constant treatment ever since. I've seen an army of psychologists, psychiatrists, doctors and other experts. None of them has ever been the least bit interested in my reports of these symptoms. Not at all. Not once. We've been working on my traumas, my strategies, I've been on medication and I've come a long way. But the PNES has never gotten better - only worse TBH.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy brother suggested I might be suffering from ADHD or ADD and I went to a new psychiatrist to explore this. For some reason I decided to insist on explaining the PNES symptoms (I didn't yet know PNES existed). At first he dismissed it like everybody else but I insisted. ""No, you don't get it. I get seizures. I end up shaking on the ground with my eyes rolling back in my head, crying, almost completely unable to speak or think. It is tremendously painful. Not physically painful but psychologically. It is a very big symptom. IT MUST MEAN SOMETHING.""\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got through and he thought it best to schedule and EEG. He didn't say anything about PNES and my guess is he does know what it is at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday my SO was desperate because I've had PNES every day for 10 days or so. She searched my symptoms on google and found out about PNES. Today I've been reading up on it and found this place. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs PNES very rare or something? Or what is it about these symptoms that make all the freaking experts just dismiss it out of hand? Does anybody else have a similar history? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy symptoms are almost always connected to stress. I have traumas and a lot of psychological symptoms that nobody has ever been able to diagnose with any degree of accuracy (to my mind). it seems that uncertainty is a major factor. If somebody asks me a question (while I'm stressed or close to a PNES attack) where I have to go over multiple scenarios in my mind to come up with an answer, it's almost certain I'll get the PNES. It is like my brain cannot deal with the chaos. Like it cannot make order of the world - like there is just too much information - too many possibilities... And then it just melts down. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFeel free to ask me questions or comment with whatever you like.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PNESsupport/comments/liyrcw/a_breakdown_of_my_symptoms_and_medical_history/

l0oue2,1611078061,My neurologist thinks I have PNES,"Looking for some answers\n\nI went to my Dr for what I thought was diabetes about two years ago. I felt like I'd have blood sugar spikes that would make things fuzzy, mood swings, and confused, peeing more than usual, and fatigue. I also had a couple of infections that weren't healing properly. Diabetes run in my family, so I figured we should look into this, as I am overweight as well. Husband thought I was having seizures as I was unresponsive in these episodes, and afterwards was pretty out if it.\n\nDiabetes test negative so Primary Dr refers to Neurologist. Neurologist orders test. EEG and MRI. Asks me to keep a journal. While there were some concerns that I had (for example they found a cyst on my basal ganglia likely benign). The neurologist never called me back with my results for MRI and EEG triggered what I believed to be a seizure. My husband had to come and pick me up from the hospital were the procedure was performed. That week afterwards was hell, and my symptoms started to get worse. I now couldn't talk and started to get weakness on my left side. I was so sure that something would pop up on test.  No call for neurologist, no improvements in symptoms for another week. We tries calling them. Couldn't get ahold of them. Finally the Nurse calls me back and says my tests were all normal.\n\nI'm continuing to have have seizures, worsening about a week before my period according to my journal. I had another flare up the week of the Christmas/New Years Holidays. Saturday I had an absence seizure, and Sunday morning  I started to get pins and needles on the left side of my face, and the my left eye starts to droop. I get paralysis on my left side. My husband takes me to the ER. We thought I was having a stroke. Test for that is negative. While in the hospital my husband and I expressed our concerns about my neurologist lack of communication with us on. We honestly believe I was having seizures, and that I was having a stroke.  My boss who is an epileptic is the one who told me that I shouldn't drive after having what we believed what I was a seizure at work! \n\nI am going to seek a second opinion, and see another neurologist. After my last appointment, my neurologist just berated me and just made me feel awful for what's going on. Still didn't offer me any information other than telling me I had conversion disorder, which led me to do some reflecting, research, and here. Im still not officially diagnosed.

kfnj5q,1608306442,PNES newly diagnosed (caretaker),"Hi, everyone. Sorry if the formatting is weird, I am on mobile. I just stumbled onto this subreddit in pursuit of trying to find help for my dad &amp; I‚Äôm just looking for some support. As if 2020 couldn‚Äôt throw any more twists at us, my dad started having seizure type episodes in April. He was diagnosed with REM sleep disorder, and after many sleep studies, EEG‚Äôs, a week long stay at Johns Hopkins, physical therapy, and so many other dr visits and referrals, it seems that he has been diagnosed with PNES since the EEG shows no neurological response to his seizures or tremors, and physical therapy showed no signs of Parkinson‚Äôs (which REM is connected to). Johns Hopkins recommends Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, but after one teleconference we have kind of been left in limbo- that was three months ago. I have uprooted my life and moved across country to help my parents out since my dad can‚Äôt really be left alone, drive, etc. and my mom is an essential worker. I feel somewhat at my wits end. I fought to get him into Johns Hopkins after no one locally had any sense of urgency and very much so ‚Äúit‚Äôs all in your head‚Äù shrug- who knows- mentality. I thought that JH would find a solution that would return some sense of normalcy to our lives and improve my dads quality of life, but that hasn‚Äôt happened.\n\nI guess I am just looking for some guidance and support from this community. What treatments have you all experienced? Did they work? He was on Keppra, but once they were deemed non-epileptic they took him off those meds and he is only on Clonopin for his sleep.. so as far as the seizures go, he is unmedicated as it seems nothing would help according to Drs. Has any medication helped for you?\n Is there something more I should be doing, somewhere else to go to help us? My dad has anywhere from about 15-20+ ‚Äúepisodes‚Äù a day, sometimes a little less, sometimes more- but that is the average. I expected to be here maybe a month and that was six months ago. Should I retrieve the rest of my belongings and call the east coast home again? Is this our new normal? Is there things I should be doing to show my dad more support, to make this easier on him? Is there something you wish someone would have done for you, or that could have made this easier when you began this journey? He retired three years ago and this is supposed to be the happy, stress free era of his life. I feel so helpless, and sometimes I just want to scream. But my stress is nothing in comparison to having your life completely uprooted by debilitating seizures, and this isn‚Äôt about me.. however I could use a hug. It is scary to see your dad deal with this. Even though I am a ‚Äúgrown adult‚Äù, it has been a rough transition internally to say the least. I didn‚Äôt expect to caretake so soon, to have to make these decisions. I am afraid constantly that he won‚Äôt come out of one of these seizures, or that they could be a stroke or something worse. I feel helpless in trying to get these doctors to listen. It is easy for them to say ‚Äúsee you in 3-6 months‚Äù when it isn‚Äôt your parent, loved one, self, going through this. With the long road yet to go, I am afraid to leave and go home and have something happen. But then my personal life is sitting in limbo as well &amp; I don‚Äôt know what is right or wrong, what is helpful or not.. which way to go at all.\n\nClearly we are all new to this and I would just really appreciate any support or guidance on what has worked for you, what we can try, anything at all really.. just to hear from people who understand these struggles would be refreshing since I feel like we are on a deserted island while life moves on for everyone else.

emgaq8,1578605334,PNES from TBI? Tryptophan???,"Hi folks, I wanted to share something with this community, in case it‚Äôs helpful for anyone. I warn you now: I‚Äôm prone to over explaining, but I think it might be justified here. Read on! \n\nAbout a year ago, I sustained a head injury and began having non-epileptic seizures. These have been diagnosed by the top epileptologist in my region of the country. His actual diagnosis was PNES, but the P part of this diagnosis never made sense to me as my accident, while frustrating and at times upsetting, never seemed to rise to the level of ‚Äútraumatic‚Äù that would cause me to develop a conversation disorder. Because of the nature of my accident, I spent months working with a psychologist to prevent the development of any type of PTSD. He also agreed that the conversation disorder diagnosis made no sense to him, as I was handling things well overall, and showed only normal anxiety about my condition, and I wasn‚Äôt subverting emotions or anything of that sort. CBT did nothing for my seizures. So I thought: okay, these may not be epileptic seizures, but they‚Äôre also not psychogenic. So what are they? And how can I treat them? \n\nI am a former teacher, I‚Äôm very familiar with research techniques. I‚Äôm also someone with a different rare chronic illness, so I know how to do a bit of medical research. I dived in. Why not? I couldn‚Äôt work, so I had time to sort through what I found. \n\nI quickly learned that there‚Äôs very little consensus among psychologists that these seizures are *always* psychogenic. My psychologist also did some research and came to the same conclusion. There are scientists in Europe who believe that these seizures, in mTBI patients, may be the result of sub-epileptic scarring or changes in the white matter of the brain. I spent months looking at medical papers and trying to follow the various courses of study (no small feat with a head injury that made reading and remembering what I‚Äôd read difficult), but I was motivated. \n\nThen accidentally, I stumbled on something that has had startling effects for me, but I think the idea that this isn‚Äôt always psychogenic in nature is key to why I was open to the idea. \n\nAbout a month and a half ago, I developed a head cold. At the time, I was having between 2 and 20 seizures a day. Mine involve intense head pain and pressure and visuals near and in my left eye, accompanied by periods of uncontrollable ‚Äúcrying.‚Äù They‚Äôre more annoying than dangerous, but they do leave me exhausted and affect my cognitive recovery. My cognitive injuries suggest that my head injury affected the right frontal, temporal and possibly occipital lobes, so pain and visuals on the left side make sense. Sleep makes a difference, and my head cold was keeping me awake, so I got some Mucinex D at the store to help me stop coughing all night. Mucinex D is guaifenesin plus pseudoephedrine, or Sudafed. \n\nThree days in, I realized I hadn‚Äôt had a single seizure since I started taking it. WTF?\n\nSome googling led me to the fact that both the medications in Sudafed and Mucinex are serotonin boosters. Given that the only drug treatment for PNES is SSRIs, or anti-depressants, I thought: ‚Äúbingo! This must be serotonin related! I‚Äôll go look it up and get an answer!‚Äù How wrong I was. While there are many articles noting that SSRIs seem to work sometimes for PNES patients, I noticed a startling lack of research into WHY that was true. I think this is because these seizures are seen as psychological in nature: of course SSRIs work, right? These folks are just struggling with mental health and SSRIs are how we treat that. \n\nThe complete lack of curiosity into why serotonin affected these attacks was maddening. What if it‚Äôs *not* because this is a mental health issue? What if it‚Äôs a physiological issue that also involves serotonin? But then I remembered that neurologists don‚Äôt know what these seizures are, why they happen, or even if they‚Äôre neurological in nature. So I guess once we get handed off to psychologists, they just don‚Äôt bother anymore with the neurology of our issues. *end rant*\n\nHere‚Äôs the thing: I can‚Äôt take most SSRIs, due to an issue with how the enzymes in my liver process medication. So I wondered... how can I boost my serotonin levels naturally? I decided, after reading more, to try boosting my tryptophan levels. I started reading about eating a combination of protein-rich foods for tryptophan and carbohydrates to help me synthesize it. And guess what! It worked! Sort of. I‚Äôve always had intense seizures after eating (another sign to me that these weren‚Äôt psychogenic was that all my triggers were physiological processes: eating, not eating often enough, lack of sleep, too much motion/visual stimulation, certain sounds, physical pain, and illness) and if I ate the carbs with my proteins, I stopped the after-food seizures! \n\nOkay, so now I was really intrigued. I decided to try modifying my diet for a week or two to see what I could do just through diet. It worked beautifully... on my food-related seizures. But not on the others. \n\nThen I made the mistake of ordering a margarita. I ordered a ‚Äúweak‚Äù margarita at a local Mexican restaurant, but the waiter misunderstood me and brought me the strongest margarita known to mankind. I have had some alcohol since my seizures began (not much of a drinker, but every now and then) and been fine, but this drink sent me into seizure city! After I sobered up, I wanted to know why. \n\nThe answer is that agave-based alcohols have a unique effect on the production of tryptophan, reducing it pretty dramatically. \n\nThat‚Äôs when it hit me. What if the answer wasn‚Äôt serotonin? What if it was tryptophan? I mean, if this was purely a serotonin issue, I‚Äôd probably be having other effects, on my mood and on my sleep. But I‚Äôm mostly stable emotionally, even reasonably cheery for my circumstances, and I sleep okay. So I looked up tryptophan and discovered something called the Kynurenine Pathway (KP). \n\nNow, I‚Äôm not a neurologist, and this shit is super confusing, but basically, 5% of your tryptophan goes into serotonin and melatonin production. The rest goes into the KP. Tryptophan gets converted to Kynurenine, which then gets converted into various substances. Get enough tryptophan, and the body produces substances that are good for the neurons in your brain. Don‚Äôt get enough, and it produces substances that are very bad for your brain, causing inflammation and other issues. Disruption of the KP has been implicated in brain diseases like Alzheimer‚Äôs. There‚Äôs evidence that brain injuries can disrupt this pathway too [(see this article). ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/26025142/)\n\nSo I thought: ‚ÄúI should take some dang tryptophan.‚Äù I bought a bottle at my local supplement store with the lowest dosages I could find: 500mg l-tryptophan. I started with a single dose before bed. Lo-and-behold... no morning seizures. \n\nSo I upped the dose to 500mg in the morning, and 500 mg at night. This lowered my daily seizure load from 2-20 to 0-2! I went days without seizures for the first time in a year. It also makes the seizures much less severe. Obviously, it didn‚Äôt 100% control them. I tried treating unusual bursts with extra tryptophan, but it‚Äôs not an instant fix. It seems to require a build-up over several hours to have any effect, and several days to really work. I think, and again, I can‚Äôt prove this, that my body naturally fills my tryptophan needs in terms of serotonin just fine, but then the extra-needy KP demands more and I just don‚Äôt have it, so... seizure. Give it the extra tryptophan, and it‚Äôs happy. I‚Äôm sure this also helps with my cognitive recovery as well. \n\nAt the end of the first month, I was near running out, so I ordered more online. The order was delayed, and I ended up with a couple days with no tryptophan. The seizures roared right back by the first morning without it. \n\nAnyway, I‚Äôm back on it today, and three hours after the first dose, I do feel a bit better. I‚Äôm going to try raising the dosage at night to see if that gives me a bit more protection during the day, when I need it most. If that doesn‚Äôt work, I‚Äôll up it in the morning. I‚Äôm still way below the max dosage for tryptophan (which is about 5 grams, or 5000mg). The only side effect I‚Äôve noticed is that it makes the blurred vision from my head injury worse, but at this time, as I‚Äôm not driving, I prefer this side effect to the seizures. \n\nAnyway, that‚Äôs my journey so far. Note: don‚Äôt try this if you already take a serotonin-boosting med, like an SSRI, as it can make you very ill. But if you don‚Äôt take anything on the interaction list, it might be worth trying for folks here. If you do, please let me know how it goes!",https://www.reddit.com/r/PNESsupport/comments/emgaq8/pnes_from_tbi_tryptophan/
