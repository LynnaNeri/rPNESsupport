But basically I\u2019ve been experiencing \u201cfainting spells\u201d since about age 12. Once I turned 18 and began living on my own they increased significantly. The past two years I\u2019ve been fainting every month or every over month, until March. No medical explanation besides \u201cit\u2019s probably syncope\u201d. I fainted once when in the Psych ward and everyone thought I had a seizure, then afterward they told me I just fainted. I didn\u2019t explain how often I was fainting, but at that time I didn\u2019t understand how serious my childhood trauma was or that it could even be connected to my mental health. \n\nI finally got diagnosed CPTSD, major depressive disorder, GAD and OCD(from childhood) this past March following a really bad bout of depression brought on by a big fight with my mother that resulted in us halting communication for a couple of months. And I had my first \u201ctremor episode\u201d (what I\u2019ve been calling them because no one knows what exactly it is yet). The feeling I have prior to the shaking is very similar to how I feel before fainting. \n\nBasically I\u2019ll usually feel \u201cout of it\u201d, weird body sensations usually on my left side, my vision will start to get \u201cstatic-ey\u201d and tunnel like, hearing becomes hypersensitive, heart rate rises, blood pressure feels like it drops. Some times I\u2019ll slur words if I try to say something. And then I\u2019ll start jerking really intensely, my hips and legs mostly. If my arms are affected I\u2019ll drop whatever it is I\u2019m holding. But my latest episode I was like punching the bed, clapping, punching myself, tapping my head. Doing really weird but specific movements. At one point i was snapping my fingers lmao. I can\u2019t even snap normally lol. My arms were twisting and my feet were turning inward. They usually last 20-30mins, but the last episode lasted well over an hour. Since these episodes started in March, I haven\u2019t been losing consciousness. Sometimes I\u2019ll disassociate but I fight to stay conscious so I can pay attention to what my body is feeling. \n\nMy neuro said they sound stress/anxiety induced and said I can do an eeg and mri to help ease my anxiety. Am I crazy for thinking she should be more concerned? Shouldn\u2019t we be ruling out epilepsy so I can get closer to figuring out the actual cause? My therapist (in my group for PTSD) said she sees this pretty often with PTSD patients, and calls them pseudo seizures. I just want an answer because every time this happens to me it\u2019s really really frightening. I\u2019m so confused, what doctor should I be seeing? My neuro seems very dismissive and it\u2019s scaring me tbh. I\u2019m going through with the EEG and MRI regardless, as recommended by my psychiatrist.

Reason I come here for support is because I've been told a lot of the symptoms are similar if not the symptoms to PNES. \n\nFor the first question, over the past two years my symptoms have worsen. I twitch, I spaz, and I freeze. It's gotten to a point that it makes me feel like I can't be left alone or drive long distances or do anything by myself. Just this morning I collapsed in the shower, not able to put weight onto anything or talk for like 30 mins at least. I don't mind being around people but I like my independence. Also after every episode my brain feels fuzzy so there is only so many people I can stand to be around in that state. To make matters worse I broke up with my significant other/best friend recently. They're going through their own mental health crisis and don't ever want to leave the house or see people. And I'm totally empathetic just with everything else going on in my life it makes me feel like I lost the person I trusted to take care of me if things go south and can stand in any kind of mental state. I feel like I won't be able to live alone anymore. Like I need a nurse but I'm only in my early 20s. Did anyone else feel like they couldn't live alone? If you do live alone how to do you cope? Do you have like a life alert system or something if you have a seizure in a severely inopportune place? Does anyone feel like they are a strain on the people that they trust to help when it gets bad? Or do you find it better to deal with it yourself than lean on people when it gets bad?\n\nFor my second inquiry, I know y'all aren't doctors but I'm mainly looking similarities or differences between my condition and the people in this community. Does anyone freeze for seizures? Or maybe tick like you have Tourettes? Or even able to suppress the symptoms even if takes a lot of energy? Anyone here have PNES and Tourettes? I'm transgender as well so if anyone has taken testosterone here did it negatively affect your condition? Does anyone vocalize when seizing (like a whistle, a click, or a random Link from Zelda type noise)? Anyone else get the fuzzy feeling in their head after an episode?

I\u2019D been to the ER as a kid and wore a heart monitor. It came back that my heart wasn\u2019t the issue, but the doc said it seemed ok. I continued to faint occasionally (like once or twice a year, followed by convulsions. Before hand I would be lightheaded and start slurring.) and apparently was convulsing as well, although my parents never told me the convulsing occurred. I thought I was just lying still while unconscious. \n\nFlash forward to the future where I\u2019m an adult. The fainting spells become much more frequent. About two years ago, around age 21 they become very frequent. Sometimes twice a month or once a month. And if I don\u2019t hit the ground I still experience light headedness. I also experience issues with focus/memory loss, but never thought the two may be connected. I kinda figured I might have something else or I just need to work through my trauma and maybe I will be able to focus on things. \n\nI once woke in the middle of the night feeling ill. Went to use the restroom and fainted, hit my head and loss consciousness. This one was a red flag bc my body woke me just to faint. \n\nNow a couple years later (age 23) I\u2019ve been to the ER twice this past month because I\u2019ve started experiencing these \u201cepisodes\u201d. \n\nTo start I felt some weird body sensations, and then I felt my heart constrict. After that I tried to say something to my sister, to let her know I wasn\u2019t feeling well and was probably going to pass out. My words came out like gibberish. Then a few seconds later I started having muscle spasms. My back was arching a bit and my legs were kicking. My jaw clenched shut as well. My arms were also shaking. I was fully conscious through the whole thing, and this was the first time thats ever happened to me. It lasted about 20 minutes. When I went to the ER they just gave me Ativan and said I needed to see a neurologist. Same thing happened the next day as well, and pretty much for the week after. The week after that it stopped, and then this week, it started up again. \n\nI got up, felt dizzy/odd sensations. My hearing became hypersensitive. And the wrongs words came out when I tried to form a sentence. Then I started convulsing again while fully conscious. I Can feel all my muscles contracting and it\u2019s so odd. \n\nI\u2019m not looking for a diagnosis, I\u2019ll wait for my neurology appt for that. Just wondering if anyone has experienced similiar?

When she was diagnosed with epilepsy, the seizures were really rare -- even 6 months apart. Since she's had the PNES diagnosis they've become much more frequent, even more than once a week. Today she had three. She started the 3-month PNES program last week virtually.\n\nSince the PNES diagnosis she's been taking time off from work and living with my grandparents out of state because they don't want her to be alone. I'm now in Ohio and feeling really lost about a long term care plan. I know that my mom wants more independence but is afraid to do a lot of basic things for herself, including exercise outside. FWIW, she can't afford to retire yet. \n\nI'm afraid that her not working is only compounding her anxiety of the outside world and making it harder to avoid triggers that might make her anxious. I'm afraid that it will be even harder to manage the seizures get back to her full life as much as possible. At this point, my family is afraid to even talk with her about her future for fear it will trigger more seizures. But at what point will she be ready? Living in this frozen moment isn't helping her anxiety and psychological issues. \n\nHow do caregivers come up with a long term care plan? Do I need to plan to move back to Ohio?

What treatment options should I consider?\n\nBackground:\n\nI am a 23 year old male who has been struggling with a seizure-like disorder for about one year now.\n\nIn the last seven years, I had a few rare incidences following some stressful events where I lost consciousness for around seven seconds and was shaking/jerking up but able to remain standing. Only on one of the occasions did I fall down but was not injured. These events subsided and didn\u2019t come back until a year ago.\n\nOne year ago I consumed psilocybin in the form of magic truffles for the third time in my life and the episodes reappeared again a week or two after but this time they were much more frequent and severe. I found myself losing my vision, consciousness, and memory several times a day. Often the seizure-like episodes would cause me to shake. They were happening up to 40 times per day and were up to 12 seconds in duration. The episodes were very disruptive and were negatively affecting my mental health including mood, socialization, and concentration.\n\nTwo months after the frequent episodes started last year, I decided to see a neurologist who gave me an MRI and EEG. Both tests came back as normal. I got a second opinion from another neurologist who thought it might be that I have juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). I was given lamotrigine for a few months but it didn\u2019t seem to help much other than possibly shorten the frequency of the seizures.\n\nI then saw another neurologist who specializes in epilepsy and she is not sure if I even have epilepsy to begin with. She thinks I could have psychogenic seizures and/or epilepsy. She is doubting the JME diagnosis but has not been able to rule out another form of epilepsy. She switched my medication from lamotrigine to briviact. Since starting brivact, my episodes involving shaking rarely come and I find my condition(s) less disruptive which likely suggests that I do have epilepsy as I appear to be responding better to briviact (although I am not sure if this is a placebo effect or not). But I still have several non-shaking episodes each day that affect my memory, mood, and concentration. These happen up to around 20-30 times per day for up to six seconds. They seem to be triggered by stress and anxiety. I am wondering if my epileptic seizures are better because they are being treated with medication but I think I could be having psychogenic seizures that have been untreated.\n\nThe seizures that remain involve me holding my breath, losing concentration, getting stiff in my upper body and neck, and often making a strange uncontrolled arm movement where my hand reaches and grabs the back of my neck or collarbone.\n\nMy hunch is that I have both epileptic and non-epilpetic psychogenic seizures which would explain why my condition has improved a bit since starting an anti-epilpetic medication but why my non-shaking episodes have not improved. I wonder if my last psychedelic trip changed something in my brain?

Nothing happened to me that prevents me from functioning normally today. My brain was fairly sharp during a two hour shaking episode and I am managing my mental health really well by preventing triggers, etc. Are pseudoseizures preventable? A therapist would not help me if I had an attack while feeling calm and happy prior to the event. It's not a flashback or a panic attack, it caused me to stutter for four days and it gave me an abnormal brain fog. It definitely isn't malingering.

Can you guys tell me if this sounds like something you relate to? \n\nI've always wondered about is this response I seem to have when I get to this point of overwhelm and my brain \"breaks\".  It's always been triggered during periods of prolonged stress and extreme guilt in unhealthy relationships, and will get triggered by something seemingly minor at the time.  I have been told it's some kind of panic attack by docs, nurses, a therapist but I never have felt like that actually fits at all.  It seems like the opposite of a panic attack to me- it feels like my heart and breathing all slow and I just become still and I escape everything for a while and dissociate from everything and everyone fully.  It kind of builds up slowly or suddenly into this period where I can't move at all or feel anything, can last for an hour or many and it takes me a few days to recover after.  I go into a trance and stare blankly at nothing and can barely communicate- usually just very basic things in a strange, monotone voice that isn't me and is apparently super creepy.  I would swear I don't even blink for hours but I don't actually know if that's possible (?) I feel paralyzed and small and don't know what to do with myself and i'm extremely calm at the same time.  I can never tell if I'm afraid to move, unwilling to move, or if I physically can't move.  It's almost a welcome relief because all my emotions and thoughts just stop completely, but it can be objectively scary, especially the first time it happened.  It's only happened about 4 times over the last 4 or so years, and I've learned that guilt and shame are my biggest triggers. \n\nThe very first time it happened I had a sensation before it started where I suddenly felt physically high and light-headed and like the room was moving, like when you smoke too much weed, although I hadn't done any.  (i'm not into weed or any non-medical drug use for myself).  Knowing I hadn't done drugs and shouldn't randomly feel high, I freaked out and I was convinced my brain was bleeding or I had eaten something poisoned and was about to die and I started freaking out at my parents to call an ambulance.  Then within a couple minutes I sat and went into that frozen, calm state that I described earlier, afraid to move because I still thought I was dying and waited for them to come.  When the paramedics came they said they didn't know what it was but it didn't seem like panic attacks they usually respond to and whatever body stats they measured were abnormal.  They took me to the hospital, I was frozen in my position and they had to lift me and wheel me in.  I was frozen at the hospital for hours and then they gave me drugs to relax me and did brain scans and tests and didn't find any issues so they sent me home with some antidepressants and said it was probably a panic attack (which I've always been confused about).  The antidepressants actually work really well for me and I've been on and off the same ones ever since.  Whenever I've experienced this kind of shut down again I have always been on a break from those meds.  So luckily, I think they help me a lot and I'm glad I went to that hospital.  All other other times this happened it was less sudden and I recognized the feeling coming so I wasn't as scared and confused.  Usually it's more distressing to the person I am with at the time because it's concerning to witness, or they are someone who thinks I am faking and need to snap out of it (couple bad relationships).  I've never known how to explain it, and never understood it myself and only just today learned about these non-epileptic seizures.  It seems so much more accurate than panic attacks to me which I always felt wrong identifying it with.  I think I have even had some mild panic attacks before but they were sweaty, hyperventilating, panicky things that only lasted a few minutes.  Those also don't seem to happen when I am medicated.  I always think the PNES(?) experience I have seems like how some animals must feel when they are in imminent danger and they freeze and \"play dead\".\n\nIs this similar to any of what you guys experience? \n\nI'm also wondering if anyone else who experiences this relates to having a bad memory through their life.  I don't remember events from my past very well, good or bad.  I don't trust feelings I had from. Childhood to now and tend to think I've made stuff up because I can't remember details.  I feel really disconnected and hateful of my past self, even though it's not like I have done really bad things.  I'm finding it hard doing therapy and working through the roots of my issues when I genuinely don't remember or trust anything from before now, and I feel like it's not part of me at all.  \nI have been working hard on myself for a while and trying to reconnect all aspects of who I am and be understanding and I am making progress but the memory issue is a huge pain for me.  My mind just goes so weird and blank even with neutral and very simple things I should be able to recall.\n\nFor some reason all of this feels related.  I think I shut out parts of me and my feelings and memories really efficiently all the time, and when I go into this frozen state it feels like EVERYTHING shuts down at once. \n\nSorry that's so long!

It's either that or I've had to go to the hospital and get charged $3000. Do any of you have advice for stopping them once they've begun? Because for me, it literally will go on for hours and it's very painful as I'm sure you know.\n2.  What do your personal seizures look like? My whole body begins to tingle and then all my muscles begin to convulse. My hands and feet end up in a completely locked position and my tongue will go numb so I am unable to speak.

Doctors and neurologists ran several tests and couldn\u2019t figure out what was wrong with me. My mom thinks it was because my blood sugar was high\u2026 got tests for diabetes etc. and they all came back normal. \nFast forward to about high school, I started getting really bad anxiety and panic attacks. They started when I was sitting on my knees for too long and my legs fell asleep; this triggered a flashback to when I use to have grand mal\u2019s (seizures started in legs), which then led me into a constant state of panic and anxiety. \nFrom then on, my nerves started twitching a lot, I got bad headaches, and weird shock-like feelings in my head whenever I got really anxious/stressed. At this time, my mom didn\u2019t really care too much to see what was wrong, so I ended up just dealing with these things until I was too distracted to notice and until they went away.\nNow, I am in college. This year was very tough for me emotionally: I became suicidal, depressed, and I started self-harming. Now, I\u2019ve been in therapy for almost 8 months, so I\u2019ve dealt with these problems. I\u2019ve noticed, though when I get very anxious and start dissociating, I start twitching bad, getting shock feeling in head, headaches, weird feeling behind eyes, or I freeze and zone out completely to the point where I can\u2019t even talk. \nI\u2019ve done to the doctors office last week, all my tests came back normal, no diabetes. I\u2019ve mentioned my headaches to my therapist and she things they\u2019re caused by anxiety. So, she referred me to a psychiatrist to get anxiety medication, along with that , I also have a neurologist appointment coming up. For so long I thought seizures were just grand mal, but now I\u2019m worried that I\u2019m having focal or absent seizures without knowing. \nThis even led me to question my mom and why she\u2019s neglected this for so long during my childhood. My doctor prescribed me keppra and I was taking it for about 3 years, but then my mom refused to refill my prescription and even tried to outsmart my doctors. So, they never figured the cause of my seizures. Now that I think about it, it was probably caused by stress (neglectful parents that worked a lot. One parent drug addict. I was sexually abused around the time of my seizures. I was also emotionally abused all throughout childhood).\n\n\nI know this is very long, but I am so lost right now. I can\u2019t stop ruminating on my awful childhood.

My seizures are since much more controlled and milder but i'm still capable of having pretty bad seizures.  If I'm not having mild muscle jerking or a 'light' 15-30min seizure, then my seizures are at least 2 hours long with extreme catatonia and dissociation which completely locks the speech part of my brain.  Because of this, I am always really worried I'll have a bad seizure like this from triggers I can't always avoid in everyday-life, or new triggers I'm not expecting, and feel that it's best I inform my partner that I am diagnosed, these seizures happen, sometimes I can't talk, and they are not life threatening and please do not panic or call an ambulance.  I also just generally dread telling people because I feel like I can watch the expression in their face as their opinion of me goes from \"cool normal person\" to, \"oh, you're one of 'those' people\" and I really hate that feeling.  It feels like a lightbulb switches on in their head like \"aha, I found what's wrong with you.\"  I don't feel like it's right for someone to perceive me as 'disabled' or 'special needs' because unless it's really bad, which is very uncommon now, I function just like everyone else, I just have a few situational triggers I avoid and that's it.  But honestly I don't know if I do or do not qualify for those labels. \n\nAnd as far as support goes in my experience, some partners would literally forget I have PNES after me explaining it and having mild seizures in front of them multiple times, others would offer to 'hug' me in that kind of body hold that helps create resistance for the muscle movements and calm them down. \n\n\nSo **TLDR:**  How do you explain your PNES to new people you date?  When do you decide to tell them?  What kind of reactions have you gotten?  Do your partners do anything special to help you during a seizure or symptoms?  Do they remember your triggers and proactively help you?  Do you have any special routines around your PNES?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "PNESsupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_vbx2a", "subreddit_subscribers": 628, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How do your partners cope &amp; support you?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PNESsupport/comments/pisidz/how_do_your_partners_cope_support_you/"}

I\u2019ve been feeling down but I wanted to share my experience with CBT. \n\nSo I am going to therapy for my anxiety and trauma. It was recommended for me so I can understand myself better. I started CBT last year in September or November. I didn\u2019t have the greatest experience because I thought it was ineffective. I was not receiving any response to how I was feeling or response. I wanted to see a specialist that understood PNES. After some time, I started to search for another therapist. Someone that can better communicate what I\u2019m experiencing and I can receive feedback no matter how positive or negative. \n\n\nSo I did. I got a therapist that challenges me and makes me think of how I perceive my trauma. I\u2019m learning a lot about myself. I\u2019m extremely sensitive and the reason I\u2019m always tired is because I\u2019m really sad. I have a lot pressure from my family and school. My background is the biggest challenge/barrier. I\u2019m learning some people do have it easier than me and that\u2019s okay. I\u2019m okay with that because by now I know I\u2019m not neglecting my mental wellness anymore. It\u2019s hard not to compare because of social media and feeling like I\u2019m going through this alone. Grateful for this subreddit. It always makes me feel better about myself. I went years doing that. I kept on slipping but I\u2019m facing it head on every single day. I lack healthy boundaries. My best qualities are what it easy for people to take advantage of them. I\u2019m getting a psychiatrist evaluation \n\nTake your time trying to get better. You\u2019re in no rush. I hope you all get there happy. \n\nIm just hear to say to take advantage of this if you can. I want to get better. I don\u2019t want to feel down or sad about myself anymore. Although we can all wish we could have been more careful.

Somehow, I fit both of these diagnoses perfectly.\n\nSo now I'm confused. I've been doing treatments recommended for FND/PNES (limit stress, ID triggers, cut off all substances) and have seen great improvements- I've even started taking SSRIs and going to more intense therapy. I've seen improvements- I went from daily seizures to weeks without seizures with the occasional breakthrough seizure but that was always during times of stress. Now it turns out my seizures may have a physical cause... so what do I do now?\n\nI know you can have epilepsy and FND at the same time, but I guess I'm just so shocked that there's a physical cause that I'm hoping someone else can relate?\n\nI hope y'all have a good day.
