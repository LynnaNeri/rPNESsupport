cmrp0c,1565103735,Can anyone shed some light on my situation?,"I recently have been experiencing PENS associated with my chronic pain. Whenever I have what I call a ‚Äúbad attack‚Äù of my pain I can sometimes faint, go into a spasm like state and drool a lot. I‚Äôm also unresponsive and I don‚Äôt remember any of it. The pain I experience can be so bad I‚Äôm left screaming and trying to bite things to muffle my loudness. My question is, can extreme pain really cause this? I don‚Äôt have any recollection of it and definitely do not have epilepsy. However I do have a neurological condition that causes my chronic pain. Any help would be much appreciated and thankyou for reading!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/PNESsupport/comments/cmrp0c/can_anyone_shed_some_light_on_my_situation/
c6sy30,1561773255,Medic Alert?,I was officially diagnosed with conversion disorder (which takes the form of PNES) and I‚Äôve been looking for a medical alert for seizure disorder or PNES so people will stop calling an ambulance when ai have a seizure even when I tell them not to. Unfortunately all I can find are ones for Epilepsy.\n\nDoes anyone know where in Southern Ontario or online I can find one? üëè,https://www.reddit.com/r/PNESsupport/comments/c6sy30/medic_alert/
c6rjew,1561765175,VEEG and repetitive stereotyped mouvements because of Asperger,"Hi,\n\nI was hospitalized without really figure it out at the beginning because I got a big seizure. I had multiple seizures the same week so they decided to do a long term vEEG. However, sometimes I have some repetitive movements with my leg and that‚Äôs totally volunteer but because it seemed like myoclonic jerks they say it‚Äôs PNES. I often do it when I‚Äôm bored which was the case at the hospital. What can I do about it?\n\nI still have the seizures where all my body moves in rythme and I‚Äôm confused after. The worst part, is that I hurt badly (burns, bruises, broken bone...)  myself often because of those seizures.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PNESsupport/comments/c6rjew/veeg_and_repetitive_stereotyped_mouvements/
bxmpmu,1559858872,Struggling with my new PNES diagnosis,"A week ago I was in hospital for a video EEG and neuropsychological test. 2 days into my stay, 4 doctors came in and handed me a pamphlet. \n""You don't have epilepsy. You have PNES and we can't treat you for that. Talk to a therapist."" And then I was released. \n\nMy seizures happen 10-15 times a day, every single day. I get them at night, too. They affect me greatly, to the point where I can't walk very far without a cane. \n\nEver since I told my family and friends about the diagnosis, everyone has been distancing themselves. I reach out to friends for support but they avoid talking to me. My dad, who I currently live with, is acting as if it's my fault I'm having the seizures and that I should be normal now that we know it's not epilepsy. He's becoming resentful that he has to drive me places, whereas he was fine with it when he thought I had epilepsy. \n\nMy therapist is away on holiday so I won't be able to see her until next week. I just feel so isolated right now. I'm tired and feel sick all the time, but everyone just acts like it's not happening.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PNESsupport/comments/bxmpmu/struggling_with_my_new_pnes_diagnosis/
bwi3sa,1559607325,SSI for PNES,"I (21 F) have had PNES since I was 15. When I started having siezures in highschool, I spent 4 days in the local hospital. (In which, doctors don't care that much) They monitored me and I had a seizure while in the hospital, which of course showed nothing abnormal on an EEG, and nothing came up on the MRI or CT scans. And at the time I was diagnosed with PNES. As soon as my parents heard the word ""Pseudo"" they started telling me I was faking it all. Made things even worse. But, they took me out of school because I was a liability to the school, and they received SSI for me.\n\nSo, anyway, now I'm 21. I still have seizures. My PC Doctor prescribed me seizure medication (Topiramate) and I take it with my other medications daily, but sometimes it seems my seizures break through when I'm in an extremely stressful situation. And I'm now on my 3rd concussion within a year due to this. \n\nGuess I'm just wondering if anyone has had any luck getting SSI for PNES and what tips you have in getting approved (other than gathering as much evidence as possible)?\n\nTL;DR: Had seizures since 15, now 21, wondering about getting SSI due to concussions caused by seizures.",https://www.reddit.com/r/PNESsupport/comments/bwi3sa/ssi_for_pnes/
bi4bp1,1556403482,Newly Diagnosed and Feeling Lost,"Hi there. This past week I (24f) received a PNES diagnosis after years of seizures and months of testing. I‚Äôm rather bummed about this and feel so alone. I don‚Äôt have other mental health struggles so I feel blindsided by this diagnosis. \n\nDo you have any advice or personal stories that you are willing to share? Have you found therapy (and medications) to help? I dream of becoming a mother through birth and/or adoption and my biggest worry is how this threatens that. \n\nAny insight would be really appreciated!! Thank you!
